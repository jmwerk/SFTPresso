## 1. Overview

SFTPresso lets you add, edit, or delete files in a local directory and have those changes sync to a remote server directory over **SFTP (SSH)** or **FTP/FTPS**. The most basic setup requires only a few lines of configuration, while a wide array of options covers advanced needs — multiple servers, switchable profiles, SSH connection hopping, file watchers, and atomic uploads.

### Primary purposes

- **Remote deployment while editing locally** — keep a familiar local editor and environment and mirror your work to a web server, staging box, or embedded device on every save.
- **Remote file management** — browse, view, edit, create, and delete files on the server directly from the SFTP sidebar without leaving VS Code.
- **Directory synchronization** — one-shot or continuous sync in either (or both) directions, with fine-grained control over deletes, creates, and overwrites.
- **Multi-environment workflows** — one config with named profiles (e.g. `dev`, `prod`) or several configs mapped to different subfolders of the same workspace.

## 2. Installation and Setup

### Installing the extension

As of **v1.20.2**, every tagged release is published automatically to both the **VS Code Marketplace** and **Open VSX** by [`.github/workflows/publish.yml`](https://github.com/jmwerk/SFTPresso/blob/develop/.github/workflows/publish.yml), so you can install it straight from your editor:

1. Open the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`).
2. Search for **SFTPresso** and install it — or run `ext install jmwerk.sftpresso` from the Command Palette.
3. If you still have an older `sftp` extension installed (from `@liximomo` or `@Natizyskunk`), SFTPresso detects it on startup and prompts you to disable it — see [Legacy extension detection](#legacy-extension-detection).

Listings: [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jmwerk.sftpresso) · [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/jmwerk/sftpresso) (for VSCodium, Gitpod, Eclipse Theia, and other editors that use Open VSX).

To sideload a specific build instead, install from a VSIX package:

1. Grab a `.vsix` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jmwerk/SFTPresso/releases) — or build one from source (see [Development and Contributing](#9-development-and-contributing)).
2. In VS Code, open the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`).
3. Open the **⋯ (More Actions)** menu at the top of the Extensions view and choose **Install from VSIX…**.
4. Locate the `.vsix` file and select it.
5. Reload VS Code. If you still have an older `sftp` extension installed (from `@liximomo` or `@Natizyskunk`), SFTPresso detects it on startup and prompts you to disable it — see [Legacy extension detection](#legacy-extension-detection).

To build the VSIX yourself:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jmwerk/SFTPresso.git
cd vscode-sftp
npm install          # also applies bundled patches via patch-package
npm run package      # produces sftpresso-<version>.vsix via vsce
```

### Legacy extension detection

SFTPresso is a fork, and the extensions it forked from — `sftp` from `@liximomo` and `vscode-sftp` from `@Natizyskunk` — register commands under the same `sftp.*` namespace. If both are enabled at once, VS Code resolves the collision unpredictably: `SFTP: Upload` might silently run the other extension's handler against the same `sftp.json`, with different behavior and none of SFTPresso's fixes, and the resulting bug reports are effectively unreproducible.

On startup, SFTPresso checks whether either legacy extension is installed **and enabled** (an installed-but-disabled copy is invisible to this check and never triggers it) and, if so, shows one notification with three choices:

- **Disable the Other** — disables the conflicting extension via VS Code's own Extensions view action.
- **Show Me** — reveals the conflicting extension in the Extensions view so you can look before deciding.
- **Don't Show Again** — suppresses the prompt for this workspace only, in case the two are meant to coexist there.

Nothing is ever disabled automatically. The suppression is workspace-scoped, since the right answer can differ per project.

### First-time setup

> **Guided walkthrough:** Run **`Welcome: Open Walkthrough…`** from the Command Palette and choose **Get started with SFTPresso** for a native, checklist-style version of these steps — Create your config, Test the connection, Download the project, and Enable upload on save — each with a one-click button that runs the matching command.

1. Open the local folder you want to sync (`File → Open Folder…`).
2. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`) and run **`SFTP: Config`**.
3. When no `sftp.json` exists yet, pick how to create it:
   - **Quick setup** — a guided wizard that asks for the protocol (sftp/ftp), host, port (pre-filled 22 or 21 per protocol), username, authentication method, remote path, and whether to upload on save. For SFTP the auth choices are a password prompt at connect time (with an offer to remember it in secret storage), a private key file (`~` is expanded and the file is checked to exist), or a running ssh-agent. Answers are validated against the config schema, `sftp.json` is written, and **`SFTP: Test Connection`** runs immediately to confirm the connection works.
   - **Edit JSON** — the extension creates `.vscode/sftp.json` with a starter template. Edit it with your server details:

```json
{
    "name": "My Server",
    "host": "server.example.com",
    "protocol": "sftp",
    "port": 22,
    "username": "user1",
    "remotePath": "/var/www/project",
    "uploadOnSave": false
}
```

4. Save and close `sftp.json`. The extension activates automatically whenever a workspace contains `.vscode/sftp.json`.
5. Type `SFTP` in the Command Palette to see all available commands (see the [Command Reference](#3-command-reference)). Many are also available from the file explorer and editor context menus.

Notes:

- `password` is optional — if omitted you'll be prompted when a connection is made, and offered to have the password remembered in VS Code's secret storage (see [Storing passwords securely](#storing-passwords-securely)). If you do store it in `sftp.json`, be aware it is **plain text** (see [Best Practices](#6-best-practices)).
- Backslashes and other special characters in JSON values must be escaped with a backslash.
- `sftp.json` gets schema-validated in the editor, so you get completions and warnings for unknown or mistyped option names.

### Verifying your connection

Run **`SFTP: Test Connection`** from the Command Palette, or click the **Test Connection** CodeLens shown at the top of `sftp.json`. It connects using the active profile's settings and reports success or failure with an actionable message (see [SSH connection error messages](#ssh-connection-error-messages)).

A **connection-status indicator** in the status bar reflects the live state of the remote connection at a glance: a plug icon when idle, a spinner while connecting or reconnecting, an active-VM icon when connected, and an error icon (with a highlighted background) when a connection fails. Because connections reconnect lazily on the next operation, this makes silent reconnects and authentication failures visible. Clicking it runs **`SFTP: Test Connection`**.

### Storing passwords securely

Instead of writing `password` into `sftp.json` (which is plain text), you can keep it in VS Code's secret storage, which is backed by the operating system keychain:

- Run **`SFTP: Save Password`**, pick the remote, and enter the password. Future connections use it automatically — no prompt, nothing in `sftp.json`.
- Or just connect: when you're prompted for a password and the connection succeeds, the extension offers to **remember** it.
- Already have a plaintext `password` in `sftp.json`? Run **`SFTP: Migrate Plaintext Password`** (or click **Migrate Password** on the warning) to move it into secret storage and strip the `password` key from the file in one step — comments and formatting are preserved, and you're asked to confirm first.
- Run **`SFTP: Clear Password`** to delete a saved password (for example after it changed on the server).

Saved passwords are keyed by `protocol://username@host:port`, so each server/user pair is stored independently (configs and profiles that point at the same server share one saved password). A saved password is only used when the config provides no other authentication — configs that set `password`, `privateKeyPath`, `agent`, or `interactiveAuth` behave exactly as before. If `sftp.json` still contains a plaintext `password`, the extension logs a one-time reminder in the output channel and offers a **Migrate Password** button to fix it.

### Host key verification

Every SFTP connection now checks the server's SSH host key before handing over your credentials, the same way `ssh`, `scp`, and every other SSH client does. Without that check, a server that answers on the right address is trusted on its say-so — which is exactly what a man-in-the-middle needs.

**Where keys come from.** Your own `~/.ssh/known_hosts` (and `known_hosts2`, plus `/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts` on macOS and Linux) is consulted first, so a host you have already accepted with `ssh` is trusted here too and never prompts. Hashed entries — what `HashKnownHosts yes`, the default on most distributions, writes — are matched, as are wildcards, `!` negations, `@revoked`, and `[host]:port` entries for non-default ports.

Keys you accept **in SFTPresso** are written to a `known_hosts` file of the extension's own, inside its global storage directory. It is in exactly the same format, so you can read or edit it with the usual tools. Your `~/.ssh/known_hosts` is never appended to — that file belongs to your ssh client.

**What happens when.** Governed by [`strictHostKeyChecking`](#stricthostkeychecking), which defaults to `"accept-new"`:

- **First sight of a host.** Under the default the key is trusted and remembered silently. Set `"ask"` to be shown a modal first, with the host, port, key type, and the `SHA256:…` fingerprint in the same form `ssh-keygen -lf` prints — so you can compare it against the server character for character — and the choice of **Connect Once**, **Connect and Remember**, or cancel.
- **A key that matches.** Connects silently.
- **A key that changed.** The connection is **refused**, with an alarm naming both fingerprints and where the stored one came from. There is deliberately no button to proceed: a changed key is either a server rebuild or an attack, and those two should not be one click apart. Once you have confirmed the change is legitimate, run **`SFTP: Forget Host Key`** and connect again.

**Commands.** **`SFTP: Show Host Key Fingerprint`** shows what is stored for a remote and which file each entry came from. **`SFTP: Forget Host Key`** removes those entries; if any live in a file maintained by your ssh client, it names the file and line and asks you to confirm before touching it.

> ⚠️ **Upgrading from 1.29.0 or earlier.** Host keys were not checked at all before, so nothing you connect to today is in SFTPresso's own store. With the default `"accept-new"` every existing config keeps connecting exactly as it did — the first connection after upgrading learns the key — but from then on a *changed* key stops the connection instead of being accepted silently. If your `~/.ssh/known_hosts` already holds a **stale** entry for a server (one you have been ignoring in `ssh` too), that connection will now fail; run **`SFTP: Forget Host Key`**, or fix the entry with `ssh-keygen -R`.

## 3. Command Reference

All commands live under the **SFTP** category in the Command Palette. Most are also exposed via context menus (file explorer, editor, editor title, SCM view, Remote Explorer). Commands are only available when the extension is active (workspace contains `.vscode/sftp.json`).

### Configuration and connection commands

| Command | ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SFTP: Config` | `sftp.config` | Create a new `sftp.json` for the workspace — via a guided quick-setup wizard or a starter template — or open the existing one. See [First-time setup](#first-time-setup). |
| `SFTP: Set Profile` | `sftp.setProfile` | Switch the active [profile](#profiles-dev--prod). |
| `SFTP: Test Connection` | `sftp.testConnection` | Connect to the active profile's remote and report success/failure. Also available as a CodeLens on `sftp.json`. |
| `SFTP: Disconnect` | `sftp.disconnect` | Close every pooled connection and drop it, so the next command reconnects from scratch. Every config and every [profile](#profiles), not just the active one, and it reports how many were actually open. The manual escape hatch for a connection that has stopped responding — [`operationTimeout`](#operationtimeout) should catch that on its own, but this saves you a window reload when something slips through. |
| `SFTP: Toggle Upload on Save` | `sftp.toggleUploadOnSave` | Flip the active config's [`uploadOnSave`](#uploadonsave) and write it back to `sftp.json` (comments and formatting preserved). The status bar shows a `$(cloud-upload)` indicator while it's on. |
| Add to Ignore | `sftp.addToIgnore` | File-explorer context menu command. Appends the right-clicked file or folder's workspace-relative path to the active config's [`ignore`](#ignore) array in `sftp.json` (folders as `path/**`), preserving comments and formatting; a no-op if the entry is already listed. |
| `SFTP: Open SSH in Terminal` | `sftp.openConnectInTerminal` | Open a VS Code terminal auto-logged-in to the server. Extra CLI flags can be added via [`sshCustomParams`](#sshcustomparams). |
| `SFTP: Save Password` | `sftp.savePassword` | Store a password for a remote in VS Code's secret storage (OS keychain). See [Storing passwords securely](#storing-passwords-securely). |
| `SFTP: Migrate Plaintext Password` | `sftp.migratePassword` | Move a plaintext `password` from `sftp.json` (top-level or in a profile) into secret storage, then remove the `password` key via a `jsonc-parser` edit (comments and formatting preserved); confirms before writing. Also offered as a **Migrate Password** button on the plaintext-password warning. See [Storing passwords securely](#storing-passwords-securely). |
| `SFTP: Clear Password` | `sftp.clearPassword` | Remove a saved password from secret storage. |
| `SFTP: Show Host Key Fingerprint` | `sftp.showHostKey` | Show the SSH host key(s) stored for a remote — fingerprint, key type, and which known_hosts file each came from — with a button to copy the fingerprints. See [Host key verification](#host-key-verification). |
| `SFTP: Forget Host Key` | `sftp.forgetHostKey` | Remove the stored SSH host key(s) for a remote, so the next connection treats it as a new host. This is what unblocks a connection refused because the server's key changed. Entries in files maintained by your ssh client (`~/.ssh/known_hosts`) are only removed after a confirmation naming the file and line. |
| `SFTP: Run Remote Command` | `sftp.runRemoteCommand` | Run a command on the remote over the existing SSH connection — no re-authentication. Offers [`remoteCommands`](#remotecommands) as a quick pick, or prompts for a command to type. Always confirms the resolved command and host before running it, since this executes on whatever server the active config points at. Output streams into the SFTP output channel and the exit code is reported when it finishes; a command that runs past [`remoteCommandTimeout`](#remotecommandtimeout) is killed and reported as timed out. FTP configs get an error instead of attempting the command. |

### Upload commands

Uploads overwrite the remote copy unconditionally. Enable [`conflictCheck`](#conflictcheck) to be warned first when the remote file changed since you last downloaded or uploaded it.

| Command | ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SFTP: Upload Active File` | `sftp.upload.activeFile` | Upload the file currently open in the editor. |
| `SFTP: Upload Active Folder` | `sftp.upload.activeFolder` | Upload the folder containing the current file. |
| `SFTP: Upload Project` | `sftp.upload.project` | Upload the whole project (respecting [`ignore`](#ignore) rules). |
| `SFTP: Upload Changed Files` | `sftp.upload.changedFiles` | Upload all files changed or created since the last Git commit (including deletions). Default keybinding `Ctrl+Alt+U`; also shown in the Source Control view. |
| Upload File / Upload Folder | `sftp.upload.file` / `sftp.upload.folder` | Context-menu variants that act on the right-clicked explorer item. |
| `SFTP: Upload … To All Profiles` | `sftp.upload.activeFile.to.allProfiles`, `sftp.upload.activeFolder.to.allProfiles`, `sftp.upload.project.to.allProfiles`, `sftp.upload.file.to.allProfiles`, `sftp.upload.folder.to.allProfiles` | Same as above but pushes to **every** profile defined in the config, not just the active one. |

### Download commands

| Command | ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SFTP: Download Active File` | `sftp.download.activeFile` | Download the remote version of the current file, overwriting the local copy. |
| `SFTP: Download Active Folder` | `sftp.download.activeFolder` | Download the folder containing the current file. |
| `SFTP: Download Project` | `sftp.download.project` | Download everything under [`remotePath`](#remotepath) into the workspace. |
| Download File / Download Folder | `sftp.download.file` / `sftp.download.folder` | Context-menu variants (explorer and Remote Explorer). |

### Sync commands

Sync compares timestamps and transfers only what differs; behavior is tuned with [`syncOption`](#syncoption). Enable [`syncConfirm`](#syncconfirm) to preview and confirm exactly what a sync will upload, overwrite, and delete before it runs.

| Command | ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SFTP: Sync Local -> Remote` | `sftp.sync.localToRemote` | Copies files that differ by timestamp, plus files that exist only locally. |
| `SFTP: Sync Remote -> Local` | `sftp.sync.remoteToLocal` | Same, in the opposite direction. |
| `SFTP: Sync Both Directions` | `sftp.sync.bothDirections` | Compares modification times and always keeps the **newest** version on both sides. Only `syncOption.skipCreate` and `syncOption.ignoreExisting` apply to this command. |

> If local and remote clocks disagree (server in another timezone, clock drift), set [`remoteTimeOffsetInHours`](#remotetimeoffsetinhours) so timestamp comparison stays accurate.

### Diff and compare commands

| Command | ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SFTP: Diff Active File with Remote` | `sftp.diff.activeFile` | Open VS Code's diff view: current file vs. its remote counterpart. |
| Diff with Remote | `sftp.diff` | Context-menu variant for any explorer file. |
| `SFTP: Compare Folders with Remote` | `sftp.compareFolders` | Recursively diffs a local folder against its remote counterpart; results (new-local / new-remote / modified) are listed in a QuickPick with per-file actions to open a diff, upload, or download. |

### Remote Explorer and file commands

| Command | ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SFTP: List` / `SFTP: List Active Folder` / `SFTP: List All` | `sftp.list` / `sftp.listActiveFolder` / `sftp.listAll` | List remote directory contents in a QuickPick. `List All` includes ignored files. |
| Rename | `sftp.rename.remote` | Rename or move the selected file/folder **on the remote** (Remote Explorer context menu) — a single `rename()` call regardless of size, no re-upload. A name containing `/` moves the item. Refuses to overwrite an existing destination or move the item outside `remotePath` or into itself. See [Renaming and moving files](#renaming-and-moving-files-on-the-remote). |
| Delete | `sftp.delete.remote` | Delete the selected file/folder **on the remote** (Remote Explorer context menu). |
| Create Folder / Create File | `sftp.create.folder` / `sftp.create.file` | Create a remote folder or file from the Remote Explorer. |
| Edit in Local | `sftp.remoteExplorer.editInLocal` | Download the remote file into the workspace so it can be edited (Remote Explorer opens files read-only by default). |
| View Content | `sftp.viewContent` | Open a read-only view of a remote file. |
| Reveal in Explorer | `sftp.revealInExplorer` | Jump from a remote file to its local counterpart in the file explorer. |
| Reveal in Remote Explorer | `sftp.revealInRemoteExplorer` | Jump from a local file to its remote counterpart in the Remote Explorer. |
| Refresh | `sftp.remoteExplorer.refresh` | Refresh the Remote Explorer tree. |
| Refresh Active Remote File | `sftp.remoteExplorer.refreshActiveFile` | Re-fetch the remote file open in the editor. |
| `SFTP: Filter Remote Explorer` | `sftp.remoteExplorer.filter` | Open a live, debounced quick pick that narrows the Remote Explorer to entries whose name contains the typed substring, plus their ancestor folders — including folders not yet expanded. See [Using the Remote Explorer](#using-the-remote-explorer). |
| `SFTP: Clear Filter` | `sftp.remoteExplorer.clearFilter` | Clear an active Remote Explorer filter and restore the full listing. |

### Transfer management commands

| Command | ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SFTP: Cancel All Transfers` | `sftp.cancelAllTransfer` | Stop every in-flight upload/download. Also triggered by clicking the status-bar progress counter, and from the Transfers view title bar. |
| Cancel Transfer | `sftp.cancelTransfer` | Cancel a single in-flight file — the inline ✕ button on items in the [Transfers view](#monitoring-and-cancelling-transfers). |
| Retry Transfer | `sftp.retryTransfer` | Re-queue a single failed file — the inline ↻ button on failed items in the [Transfers view](#monitoring-and-cancelling-transfers). |

### Force (Alt) commands

Hold **Alt** while a context menu is open to reveal the force variants, which **disregard [`ignore`](#ignore) rules**:

| Command | ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Force Upload | `sftp.forceUpload` | Upload even files matched by ignore rules. |
| Force Download | `sftp.forceDownload` | Download even files matched by ignore rules. |
| Force Upload To All Profiles | `sftp.forceUpload.to.allProfiles` | Force-upload to every profile. |

### Commands with keybinding arguments

| `sftp.setProfile` | `func(profileName: string)` |
| `sftp.upload` | `func(fspaths: string[])` — upload the given files/folders |
| `sftp.download` | `func(fspaths: string[])` — download the given files/folders |

Example — a keybinding that switches straight to the `prod` profile:

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+alt+p",
  "command": "sftp.setProfile",

## 4. Configuration Reference (`sftp.json`)

Configuration lives in `<workspace>/.vscode/sftp.json` — either a single object, or an **array of objects** for [multiple contexts](#multiple-contexts-array-config). Open it any time via `SFTP: Config`.

The file is read as **JSONC**: `// line comments`, `/* block comments */`, and trailing commas are all allowed, so you can annotate a config or comment out options without breaking it. Parse errors are reported with their line and column.

### Common options

Apply to both SFTP and FTP unless noted.

#### name
A string to identify your configuration. Shown in pickers when multiple configs exist. **Required when using an array (multi-context) config.**

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | — |

```json
{ "name": "My Server" }
```

#### context
A path relative to the workspace root. Use it to map a **subfolder** (rather than the whole workspace) to `remotePath`. Only available at the root level of a config (not inside profiles).

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `context` | string | workspace root |

```json
{ "context": "./build" }
```

#### protocol
Transfer protocol.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `protocol` | `"sftp"` \| `"ftp"` | `"sftp"` |

#### host
Hostname or IP address of the server.

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `host` | string |

#### port
Server port. Typically `22` for SFTP, `21` for FTP, `990` for implicit FTPS.

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `port` | integer |

#### username
Username for authentication.

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `username` | string |

#### password
Password for password-based authentication. **Optional** — omit it to use a password saved via `SFTP: Save Password`, or to be prompted at connect time (see [Storing passwords securely](#storing-passwords-securely)).

> ⚠️ **Warning:** passwords in `sftp.json` are stored as **plain text**. Prefer [`privateKeyPath`](#privatekeypath) or [`agent`](#agent) — or keep the password in [secret storage](#storing-passwords-securely) — and keep `sftp.json` out of version control. See [Best Practices](#6-best-practices).

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `password` | string |

#### remotePath
The absolute path on the remote host that maps to your local [`context`](#context). This is what `SFTP: Download Project` downloads.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `remotePath` | string | `/` |

#### filePerm
Octal permissions applied to newly created remote files.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `filePerm` | number | unset |

```json
{ "filePerm": 644 }
```

#### dirPerm
Octal permissions applied to newly created remote directories.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dirPerm` | number | unset |

```json
{ "dirPerm": 750 }
```

#### uploadOnSave
Upload the file on every VS Code save. See the [Upload on save](#upload-on-save) workflow. You can flip this without editing JSON via **`SFTP: Toggle Upload on Save`**; the status bar shows a `$(cloud-upload)` indicator while it's on.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `uploadOnSave` | boolean | `false` |

#### useTempFile
Upload to a temporary file first, then move it into place — avoids serving a half-written file to visitors while the upload is in progress.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `useTempFile` | boolean | `false` |

#### openSsh
Enable **atomic** file uploads (rename-into-place). Only supported by OpenSSH servers.

> 💡 If `openSsh` is `true`, [`useTempFile`](#usetempfile) must also be `true`.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openSsh` | boolean | `false` |

```json
{ "openSsh": true, "useTempFile": true }
```

#### downloadOnOpen
Download the remote version of a file whenever it is opened locally.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `downloadOnOpen` | boolean | `false` |

#### syncOption
Tunes the [Sync commands](#sync-commands).

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `syncOption` | object | `{}` |

| Sub-option | Type | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `syncOption.delete` | boolean | `false` | Delete extraneous files from the destination. |
| `syncOption.skipCreate` | boolean | `false` | Don't create files that are new to the destination. |
| `syncOption.ignoreExisting` | boolean | `false` | Don't update files that already exist on the destination. |
| `syncOption.update` | boolean | `false` | Only overwrite the destination if the source copy is newer. |

All four are off unless set explicitly — an omitted key has never done anything at runtime, though the JSON schema incorrectly advertised `true` as the default before this was corrected.

```json
{
  "syncOption": {
    "delete": true,
    "skipCreate": false,
    "ignoreExisting": false,
    "update": true
  }
}
```

> `Sync Both Directions` honors only `skipCreate` and `ignoreExisting`.

#### syncConfirm
Show a dry-run preview before a [Sync command](#sync-commands) runs. The extension walks the local/remote diff, computes exactly what the sync would do — respecting [`syncOption`](#syncoption) — and shows a modal summary such as *"Sync Local → Remote: 3 uploads, 1 overwrite, 2 deletions. Proceed?"* with the affected files listed. **Cancel** leaves everything untouched; **Proceed** runs the sync unchanged. If nothing differs, an info message is shown and no sync runs.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `syncConfirm` | boolean | `true` when [`syncOption.delete`](#syncoption) is enabled, otherwise `false` |

The default is deliberately conservative: syncs that can delete files on the destination prompt by default, while non-destructive syncs don't. Set it explicitly to always (or never) confirm.

If a directory can't be read while the preview is being built, it is listed as `! could not read:` and the summary says so up front — the plan below it is built only from what could be read, and is not the whole picture. The sync itself will fail on that directory rather than acting on the gap.

```json
{
  "syncConfirm": true
}
```

#### conflictCheck
Guard against uploads that would silently overwrite someone else's work. Before a file upload replaces an existing remote file, the extension checks whether the remote copy changed since you last downloaded or uploaded it. If it did, a modal shows both timestamps and offers **Overwrite**, **Open Diff**, or **Cancel** — **Open Diff** opens the local/remote [diff](#diff-and-compare-commands) and leaves the remote untouched.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `conflictCheck` | boolean | `false` |

```json
{
  "uploadOnSave": true,
  "conflictCheck": true
}
```

This is not just a local-vs-remote timestamp comparison. After each transfer of a file, the extension records what the remote looked like at that moment, and compares the remote against *that*. It matters because once you edit a file locally, your local copy is the newest one — so a plain timestamp check would call the upload safe even when a teammate changed the remote in the meantime. Until a file has a recorded baseline (nothing has been transferred yet this workspace), the check falls back to flagging a remote that is newer than your local copy.

Scope and caveats:

- Applies to **single-file uploads**, including [`uploadOnSave`](#uploadonsave). Folder uploads and the [Sync commands](#sync-commands) are not checked — a folder upload would mean prompting per file mid-transfer; use [`syncConfirm`](#syncconfirm) to review a whole tree before it runs.
- Enabling it costs one extra `stat` round-trip per file transfer (to read the remote back). It is off by default partly for that reason.
- Baselines are remembered per workspace. Uploading the same file from a **second machine** leaves the first machine's baseline stale, so the next upload there may prompt once; choose **Overwrite** and it re-syncs.
- On FTP servers that cannot set a file's modification time (no `MFMT`), the remote mtime is the upload time rather than your file's, which makes conflicts likelier to be reported. See [`remoteTimeOffsetInHours`](#remotetimeoffsetinhours) if local and remote clocks disagree.

#### ignore
Files/folders excluded from transfers and sync. Gitignore-style patterns (wildcards with `*`), relative to the config's [`context`](#context). Bypass with the [Force commands](#force-alt-commands).

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ignore` | string[] | `[]` |

```json
{
  "ignore": [
    "/.vscode",
    "/.git",
    ".DS_Store",
    "*.log"
  ]
}
```

#### ignoreFile
Path to an ignore file (e.g. `.gitignore`-style list) — absolute, or relative to the workspace root.

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `ignoreFile` | string |

```json
{ "ignoreFile": ".gitignore" }
```

#### maxFileSize
Caps individual file size (in megabytes) during a **batch** transfer — a folder upload/download or a [Sync](#sync-commands). A file over the limit is left out of the transfer rather than started, and reported afterward in a summary notification naming the count and the largest one (full list in the SFTP output), the same way [`syncOption.delete`](#syncoption) reports what it removed. Never applies to an explicitly-requested single-file transfer — right-click one file and choose Upload/Download and it always goes, regardless of size. `0` or unset disables the cap.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `maxFileSize` | number | `0` (disabled) |

```json
{ "maxFileSize": 100 }
```

#### watcher
Watches for file changes made **outside** the VS Code editor (build output, `git checkout`, external tools) and reacts automatically. See [Two-way automatic sync](#two-way-automatic-sync-with-the-watcher).

A [profile](#profiles) may override `watcher` to change what is watched — or to switch watching off entirely with `"files": false` — for that profile alone. The watcher is rebuilt when you switch profile, and the profile's [`ignore`](#ignore) rules apply to it, so an ignored path is dropped at the watcher rather than further down the transfer path.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `watcher` | object | `{}` |

| Sub-option | Type | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `watcher.files` | string (glob) | Which files to watch (required). |
| `watcher.autoUpload` | boolean | Upload when a watched file changes. |
| `watcher.autoDelete` | boolean | Delete on the remote when a watched file is removed locally. |
| `watcher.autoRename` | boolean | Server-side rename/move on the remote when a watched file or folder is renamed locally, instead of deleting and re-uploading it. See [Renaming and moving files](#renaming-and-moving-files-on-the-remote). Default `false`. |

> 💡 Set [`uploadOnSave`](#uploadonsave) to `false` when watching everything (`"**/*"`) — otherwise every save triggers both mechanisms.

```json
{
  "watcher": {
    "files": "dist/*.{js,css}",
    "autoUpload": true,
    "autoDelete": false,
    "autoRename": true
  },
  "profiles": {
    "dev": {},
    "prod": {
      "watcher": { "files": false }
    }
  }
}
```

#### remoteTimeOffsetInHours
Hours of clock difference between the remote server and your machine (**remote minus local**). Needed for accurate timestamp-based [sync](#sync-commands) when the server is in another timezone or its clock drifts.

> **FTP note:** servers that support the `MLSD` command (e.g. pure-ftpd, ProFTPD) report exact UTC timestamps, so this option should normally stay `0` for them. It's mainly needed for FTP servers limited to `LIST` (e.g. vsftpd), whose listings carry only server-local, minute-precision dates, and for SFTP servers with a skewed clock.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `remoteTimeOffsetInHours` | number | `0` |

#### remoteExplorer
Tunes the [Remote Explorer](#using-the-remote-explorer) view.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `remoteExplorer` | object | `{}` |

| Sub-option | Type | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `remoteExplorer.filesExclude` | string[] | Patterns for files/folders to hide in the Remote Explorer. |
| `remoteExplorer.order` | number | Sort position of this config among Remote Explorer roots (default `0`). |
| `remoteExplorer.enableDragAndDrop` | boolean | Allow dragging an item onto a folder in the Remote Explorer to move it there with a single server-side rename. Default `false`. See [Renaming and moving files](#renaming-and-moving-files-on-the-remote). |

```json
{
  "remoteExplorer": {
    "filesExclude": ["**/node_modules"],
    "order": 1,
    "enableDragAndDrop": true
  }
}
```

#### concurrency
Maximum simultaneous transfers. It also bounds how many directory listings the scan of a folder transfer or sync issues at once, so a large tree can't flood a single connection with requests. Lower it if your server limits concurrent connections/operations. FTP always uses `1`.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `concurrency` | number | `4` |

#### connectTimeout
Maximum time (ms) to wait when establishing a connection.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `connectTimeout` | number | `10000` |

Resolved in that order: this option if you set it, otherwise `ConnectTimeout` from your [ssh config](#sshconfigpath) (which states it in seconds), otherwise `10000`.

#### limitOpenFilesOnRemote
Cap the number of file descriptors opened on the remote server. Set `true` for the default limit (222), or a number for a custom limit (values below 127 are raised to 127). Use it if transfers fail with the generic [`Error: Failure`](#error-failure) because the server runs out of descriptors.

> 💡 **Do not set this unless you have to.**

> ℹ️ Broken between the `ssh2` 1.x upgrade and **1.26.3** — setting it threw `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'open')` and no connection could be established. Update to 1.26.3 or later if you need it.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `limitOpenFilesOnRemote` | boolean \| number | `false` |

#### profiles
A collection of named profiles keyed by profile name. Each profile is merged over the top-level config; switch with `SFTP: Set Profile`. See [Profiles (dev / prod)](#profiles-dev--prod).

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `profiles` | object |
| `defaultProfile` | string — profile activated by default |

#### remote
Reference a connection defined in User Settings under `remotefs.remote` instead of repeating host details per project. See [Configuration in User Settings](#configuration-in-user-settings-remote-fs).

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `remote` | string |

#### retry
Automatically re-runs a transfer that failed with a transient error — a dropped or reset connection, a timeout, a closed SSH channel, or an FTP 4xx reply. Failures that would fail the same way every time (permission denied, file not found, FTP 5xx) are never retried.

Each retry waits `delay × 2ⁿ` milliseconds, capped at 15 seconds — with the defaults that's 2s, then 4s. Set `attempts` to `0` to turn retrying off.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `retry` | object | `{ "attempts": 2, "delay": 1000 }` |

| Sub-option | Type | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `retry.attempts` | number | How many extra attempts a failed transfer gets (default `2`). |
| `retry.delay` | number | Base backoff in ms, doubled on every attempt (default `1000`). |

```json
{
  "retry": {
    "attempts": 3,
    "delay": 2000
  }
}
```

#### idleTimeout
Guards against servers that close an idle connection without saying so. Many shared hosts do this after a few minutes — the extension keeps handing out the pooled connection, and the next upload waits on a socket that will never answer, so it hangs until the window is reloaded.

With `idleTimeout` set, a connection that has gone unused for that many milliseconds is checked with a cheap round-trip (an SFTP `realpath`, an FTP `NOOP`) before it is handed out again. If the server answers, the connection is reused as before. If it refuses — or doesn't answer within [`connectTimeout`](#connecttimeout) — the connection is dropped and a fresh one is opened for you.

Set it a little under whatever your host allows. If it drops connections after 5 minutes, `240000` (4 minutes) leaves margin.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `idleTimeout` | number | `0` (never checked) |

```jsonc
{
  // check the connection before reusing it after 4 minutes of inactivity
  "idleTimeout": 240000
}
```

When the check passes there is nothing to see — a healthy server answers instantly and the operation carries on unchanged — so a working `idleTimeout` looks exactly like one that isn't wired up. To confirm it's active, turn on the `sftp.debug` setting and watch the **SFTP** output channel:

```
[debug] probing connection after 301204ms idle (timeout 10000ms)
[debug] probe answered, reusing the connection
```

A reconnect is reported at info level, so that line appears whether or not `sftp.debug` is on:

```
[info] reconnecting: idle connection did not answer in 10000ms (idle for 301204ms)
```

> ℹ️ The check happens when the connection is *reused*, not on a timer, so it can never interrupt a transfer that is still running — a long upload keeps the connection busy and healthy, and a live connection simply answers the probe. The trade-off is that the socket stays open while idle rather than being closed proactively; if your host counts concurrent connections rather than dropping idle ones, this option won't help with that.

#### stallTimeout
Covers the other half of the problem [`idleTimeout`](#idletimeout) solves. `idleTimeout` catches a connection that died *between* operations; `stallTimeout` catches one that dies *during* a transfer, where there is no error to react to — the bytes simply stop and the upload waits forever.

With `stallTimeout` set, a transfer that goes that many milliseconds without a single byte moving is failed rather than waited on. The failure is classified the same way a dropped connection is, so [`retry`](#retry) picks it up and runs the transfer again instead of surfacing an error.

The clock resets on every chunk, so this measures *stalling*, not total duration — a large file crawling over a slow link keeps resetting the timer and is never interrupted. Set it well above the longest pause you'd expect from a healthy transfer; 30–60 seconds is a reasonable starting point.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stallTimeout` | number | `0` (wait indefinitely) |

```jsonc
{
  // give up on a transfer that hasn't moved a byte in 30 seconds
  "stallTimeout": 30000,
  "retry": { "attempts": 2 }
}
```

#### operationTimeout
Covers the third way a connection can go quiet, and the only one of the three that is on by default.

[`idleTimeout`](#idletimeout) catches a connection that died between operations and [`stallTimeout`](#stalltimeout) catches one that died mid-transfer. Neither covers the requests that surround a transfer — the `mkdir` that creates the target directory, the directory listing that drives a sync, a `stat`, a rename, a delete. A server can leave the SSH transport up, answering keepalives perfectly happily, while the SFTP subsystem behind it stops reading its channel; every request after that is queued locally and nothing is ever answered. There is no error to react to, so the command simply never finishes.

With `operationTimeout` set, any single request that goes unanswered for that many milliseconds is failed with `ETIMEDOUT` and the connection is dropped, so the next command opens a fresh one instead of inheriting a dead one. The failure is classified as retryable, so [`retry`](#retry) applies.

This measures one round trip, not a whole operation. Transfers are not affected — `get` and `put` can take as long as the file takes, and are governed by `stallTimeout` instead. Neither are operations built out of several requests: an `ensureDir` that has to create four directories gets four separate deadlines, not one.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `operationTimeout` | number | `60000` |

```jsonc
{
  // a request that goes 30 seconds without an answer is treated as lost
  "operationTimeout": 30000
}
```

A timeout is reported at warn level, so the line appears whether or not `sftp.debug` is on:

```
[warn] remote operation "mkdir" did not answer within 60000ms; dropping the connection
```

> ℹ️ SFTP only. FTP is already covered by [`connectTimeout`](#connecttimeout), which the FTP client applies as an idle timeout on both the control and data sockets. Setting `operationTimeout` on an FTP config is accepted and ignored.

> ⚠️ Unlike the two options above, this one defaults on. A request that has gone a full minute without a reply is not slow, it's lost, and the alternative is an extension that hangs until you reload the window. If you have a genuinely slow server and see spurious timeouts, raise it rather than turning it off — `0` restores the old behaviour of waiting indefinitely.

#### remoteCommands
Labeled shell commands offered by [`SFTP: Run Remote Command`](#configuration-and-connection-commands) as a quick pick, instead of a blank prompt every time. Each command runs over the existing pooled SSH connection.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `remoteCommands` | object (label → command string) | *(none)* |

```jsonc
{
  "remoteCommands": {
    "Restart PHP": "sudo systemctl reload php8.3-fpm",
    "Clear cache": "php artisan cache:clear"
  }
}
```

Editing this doesn't invalidate the pooled connection — it's read fresh on every run, not baked into the connection identity.

> ℹ️ SFTP only. Running a command against an FTP config fails with a clear error rather than attempting it — FTP has no remote shell to run one on.

#### remoteCommandTimeout
How long, in milliseconds, a command started by [`SFTP: Run Remote Command`](#configuration-and-connection-commands) may run before it is killed and reported as timed out.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `remoteCommandTimeout` | number | `60000` |

```jsonc
{
  // give a long migration more room before it's killed
  "remoteCommandTimeout": 300000
}
```

> ℹ️ OpenSSH's server does not act on the kill request for a plain (non-pty) exec session, so a command that times out may keep running on the server after SFTPresso reports it as timed out — the SSH channel is closed on this end, but the remote process is not guaranteed to be. SFTP only.

### SFTP-only options

#### agent
Path to the ssh-agent UNIX socket for agent-based authentication (usually `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`). Windows users: set to `pageant` to authenticate with Pageant, or the path to a Cygwin "UNIX socket".

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `agent` | string |

```json
{ "agent": "/run/user/1000/ssh-agent.socket" }
```

#### privateKeyPath
Absolute path to your private key file.

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `privateKeyPath` | string |

```json
{ "privateKeyPath": "/Users/me/.ssh/id_rsa" }
```

#### passphrase
Passphrase for an encrypted private key. Set the string itself, or set `true` to be prompted with a dialog (keeps the passphrase out of the config file — recommended).

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `passphrase` | string \| boolean |

```json
{ "passphrase": true }
```

#### interactiveAuth
Enable keyboard-interactive authentication (e.g. multi-factor / Google Authenticator). Set `true` for a verification-code dialog, or pass an array of predefined responses to answer prompts automatically.

> 💡 Requires the server to have keyboard-interactive authentication enabled.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `interactiveAuth` | boolean \| string[] | `false` |

```json
{ "interactiveAuth": true }
```

#### algorithms
Explicit overrides for the SSH transport-layer algorithms. Mainly needed for older servers — see [Error: Connection closed](#error-connection-closed).

Default:

```json
{
  "algorithms": {
    "kex": [
      "ecdh-sha2-nistp256",
      "ecdh-sha2-nistp384",
      "ecdh-sha2-nistp521",
      "diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256"
    ],
    "cipher": [
      "aes128-gcm",
      "aes128-gcm@openssh.com",
      "aes256-gcm",
      "aes256-gcm@openssh.com",
      "aes128-cbc",
      "aes192-cbc",
      "aes256-cbc",
      "aes128-ctr",
      "aes192-ctr",
      "aes256-ctr"
    ],
    "serverHostKey": [
      "ssh-rsa",
      "ssh-dss",
      "ssh-ed25519",
      "ecdsa-sha2-nistp256",
      "ecdsa-sha2-nistp384",
      "ecdsa-sha2-nistp521",
      "rsa-sha2-512",
      "rsa-sha2-256"
    ],
    "hmac": [
      "hmac-sha2-256",
      "hmac-sha2-512"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### sshConfigPath
Path to your OpenSSH client config file; settings for this config's [`host`](#host) are resolved the way `ssh` itself does — literal `Host` entries, wildcard `Host` patterns (`Host *.example.com`), and `Match` blocks are all considered, in file order, per `ssh_config(5)` precedence.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sshConfigPath` | string | `~/.ssh/config` |

Six directives are read:

| Directive | Fills in | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HostName` | [`host`](#host) | Always applied — this is the point of an alias. |
| `Port` | [`port`](#port) | |
| `User` | [`username`](#username) | |
| `IdentityFile` | [`privateKeyPath`](#privatekeypath) | The first line found wins if it's set more than once. |
| `ConnectTimeout` | [`connectTimeout`](#connecttimeout) | Seconds in `ssh_config`, converted to ms. |
| `ServerAliveInterval` | [`keepaliveInterval`](#keepaliveinterval) | Seconds in `ssh_config`, converted to ms. |

Except for `HostName`, a value you set in `sftp.json` wins — the ssh config only fills in what you left out. `ConnectTimeout` and `ServerAliveInterval` are ignored, with a warning in the output channel, if their value isn't a number of seconds.

> ℹ️ **Fixed in 1.30.1.** `ServerAliveInterval` and `ConnectTimeout` were read from your ssh config and then dropped: they were mapped onto option names the SSH client does not have, so neither had any effect. If you rely on either, they start working with this release — a `ServerAliveInterval` far below the previous 30-second default means noticeably more keepalive traffic.

> ℹ️ **Fixed.** Resolution used to be a literal string match against `Host` — a config using a wildcard `Host *.example.com` pattern or a `Match` block, both ordinary `ssh_config(5)` syntax, contributed nothing at all, silently. Both are now resolved correctly.

#### sshCustomParams
Extra parameters appended to the `ssh` command used by `SFTP: Open SSH in Terminal`.

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `sshCustomParams` | string |

```json
{ "sshCustomParams": "-g" }
```

#### hop
Connect through one or more intermediate SSH hosts. A single object for one hop, or an array for multiple. See [Connection hopping](#connection-hopping-ssh-proxy--bastion). Each hop accepts the same host/auth options (`host`, `port`, `username`, `privateKeyPath`, …).

> Variable substitution does not work inside a hop configuration.

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `hop` | object \| object[] |

Every host in the chain has its own host key checked in its own right — a bastion is exactly as impersonatable as the server behind it. Hops inherit the config's [`strictHostKeyChecking`](#stricthostkeychecking) unless they set their own.

#### strictHostKeyChecking
Controls how the server's SSH host key is checked, mirroring OpenSSH's option of the same name. See [Host key verification](#host-key-verification) for what the values mean and how the store works.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `strictHostKeyChecking` | `true` \| `false` \| `"ask"` \| `"accept-new"` | `"accept-new"` |

```json
{ "strictHostKeyChecking": "ask" }
```

| Value | Unknown host | Changed key |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `"accept-new"` (default) | Trusted and remembered, no prompt | **Refused** |
| `"ask"` | Prompted with the fingerprint | **Refused** |
| `true` | **Refused** | **Refused** |
| `false` | Trusted and remembered, no prompt | Allowed, with a warning in the log |

A key marked `@revoked` in a known_hosts file is refused under every value, as is a certificate host key (SFTPresso cannot validate one).

> ℹ️ SFTP only. Setting it on an FTP config is accepted and ignored.

#### keepaliveInterval
How often, in milliseconds, an SSH-level keepalive packet is sent to the server. Guards against links that silently drop an idle connection — a NAT or firewall that closes an unused mapping, or a host that reaps connections it hasn't heard from — leaving the next operation to hang against a socket nothing will ever answer on.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `keepaliveInterval` | number | `30000` |

Resolved in that order: this option if you set it, otherwise `ServerAliveInterval` from your [ssh config](#sshconfigpath) (which states it in seconds), otherwise `30000`. Set to `0` to disable keepalive packets entirely.

```jsonc
{
  // a host that reaps idle connections after 45s needs a shorter grace period
  // than the 60s the default 30000ms / x2 gives it
  "keepaliveInterval": 15000
}
```

> ℹ️ SFTP only.

#### keepaliveCountMax
How many consecutive keepalive packets may go unanswered before the connection is considered dead and torn down. Paired with [`keepaliveInterval`](#keepaliveinterval), an unresponsive server is given up on after roughly `keepaliveInterval × keepaliveCountMax` milliseconds.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `keepaliveCountMax` | number | `2` |

```jsonc
{
  // more tolerance for a link that occasionally drops a packet
  "keepaliveCountMax": 4
}
```

> ℹ️ SFTP only.

### FTP(S)-only options

#### secure
Connection encryption mode:

- `true` — encrypt both control and data connections (explicit FTPS)
- `"control"` — encrypt the control connection only
- `"implicit"` — implicitly encrypted control connection (legacy; usually port 990)

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `secure` | boolean \| `"control"` \| `"implicit"` | `false` |

```json
{ "protocol": "ftp", "port": 21, "secure": true }
```

#### secureOptions
Extra options passed straight to Node's [`tls.connect()`](https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback) — e.g. to accept a self-signed certificate.

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `secureOptions` | object |

```json
{ "secureOptions": { "rejectUnauthorized": false } }
```

### VS Code extension settings

These are regular VS Code settings (`File → Preferences → Settings`, or `settings.json`), separate from `sftp.json`:

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sftp.debug` | boolean | `false` | Print debug output to the `sftp` Output channel. **Reload VS Code after changing.** |
| `sftp.printDebugLog` | boolean | `false` | **Deprecated** — use `sftp.debug` instead. Still honored for backward compatibility. |
| `sftp.downloadWhenOpenInRemoteExplorer` | boolean | `false` | When opening a file in the Remote Explorer, download it ("Edit in Local") instead of showing a read-only "View Content". |

---

## 5. Usage Examples and Common Workflows

### Simple single-server setup

The minimum viable config — SFTP on port 22, prompted for the password:

```json
{
  "host": "host",
  "username": "username",
  "remotePath": "/remote/workspace"
}
```

### Start from a remote project

If the latest files already live on the server, start with an **empty local folder**:

1. Open the empty folder in VS Code and run `SFTP: Config` (see [First-time setup](#first-time-setup)).
2. Set `remotePath` to the server directory you want.
3. Run **`SFTP: Download Project`** — the remote tree is downloaded into your workspace.
4. From here on, edit locally and upload/sync as needed.

### Upload on save

Mirror every save to the server:

```json
{
  "host": "server.example.com",
  "username": "deploy",
  "remotePath": "/var/www/site",
  "uploadOnSave": true
}
```

If your site is live, add temp-file/atomic uploads so visitors never see a half-written file:

```json
{
  "uploadOnSave": true,
  "useTempFile": true,
  "openSsh": true
}
```

(See [`useTempFile`](#usetempfile) and [`openSsh`](#openssh).)

If others deploy to the same server, add [`conflictCheck`](#conflictcheck) so a save can't quietly overwrite a change you never pulled down:

```json
{
  "uploadOnSave": true,
  "conflictCheck": true
}
```

### Profiles (dev / prod)

One config, several environments. Profile values merge over the top-level config; switch with **`SFTP: Set Profile`**.

When a config defines profiles, the status bar item shows the active profile (e.g. **`SFTP: dev`**, or **`SFTP: (no profile)`** when none is active), and clicking it opens the profile picker — same as running `SFTP: Set Profile`. Without profiles, the status bar keeps its usual behavior (shows `SFTP`, click to toggle the output panel).

```json
{
  "username": "username",
  "password": "password",
  "remotePath": "/remote/workspace/a",
  "watcher": {
    "files": "dist/*.{js,css}",
    "autoUpload": false,
    "autoDelete": false
  },
  "profiles": {
    "dev": {
      "host": "dev-host",
      "remotePath": "/dev",
      "uploadOnSave": true
    },
    "prod": {
      "host": "prod-host",
      "remotePath": "/prod"
    }
  },
  "defaultProfile": "dev"
}
```

> `context` is only available at the root level, not inside a profile. [`watcher`](#watcher) may be set at either — a profile's watcher is merged one level over the root one while that profile is active, so `{ "autoUpload": false }` turns uploads off for production without losing the root's other watcher settings (`files`, `autoDelete`, etc.). `syncOption` and `remoteExplorer` merge the same way when set inside a profile.

To deploy to every environment at once, use the **`… To All Profiles`** [upload commands](#upload-commands).

### Multiple contexts (array config)

Map different workspace subfolders to different servers (or different remote paths). The `context` values must differ, and `name` is **required**:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "server1",
    "context": "project/build",
    "host": "host",
    "username": "username",
    "password": "password",
    "remotePath": "/remote/project/build"
  },
  {
    "name": "server2",
    "context": "project/src",
    "host": "host",
    "username": "username",
    "password": "password",
    "remotePath": "/remote/project/src"
  }
]
```

### Connection hopping (SSH proxy / bastion)

Reach a target server through an intermediate host with the SSH protocol. Note: variable substitution does not work in a hop configuration.

**Single hop** (`local → hop → target`):

```json
{
  "name": "target",
  "remotePath": "/path/in/target",

  "host": "hopHost",
  "username": "hopUsername",
  "privateKeyPath": "/Users/localUser/.ssh/id_rsa",

  "hop": {
    "host": "targetHost",
    "username": "targetUsername",
    "privateKeyPath": "/Users/hopUser/.ssh/id_rsa"
  }
}
```

The top-level `privateKeyPath` is a file **on your local machine**; the one inside `hop` is a file **on the hop host**.

**Multiple hops** (`local → hopA → hopB → target`): make `hop` an array — each entry authenticates from the previous host, and the last entry is the target:

```json
{
  "name": "target",
  "remotePath": "/path/in/target",

  "host": "hopAHost",
  "username": "hopAUsername",
  "privateKeyPath": "/Users/localUser/.ssh/id_rsa",

  "hop": [
    {
      "host": "hopBHost",
      "username": "hopBUsername",
      "privateKeyPath": "/Users/hopAUser/.ssh/id_rsa"
    },
    {
      "host": "targetHost",
      "username": "targetUsername",
      "privateKeyPath": "/Users/hopBUser/.ssh/id_rsa"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Two-way automatic sync with the watcher

Keep the server updated with **no manual interaction** — including changes made outside VS Code, e.g. when Git checks out a branch or reverts commits:

```json
{
  "name": "My Server",
  "host": "<host_ip_address>",
  "protocol": "sftp",
  "port": 22,
  "username": "user1",
  "remotePath": "/folder1/folder2/folder3",
  "uploadOnSave": false,
  "watcher": {
    "files": "**/*",
    "autoUpload": true,
    "autoDelete": true,
    "autoRename": true
  },
  "syncOption": {
    "delete": true
  }
}
```

Keep `uploadOnSave` **false** here — the watcher already covers saves when watching `**/*` (see [`watcher`](#watcher)). `autoRename` here means a rename or move made in VS Code's own Explorer moves the remote copy instead of deleting and re-uploading it — see [Renaming and moving files](#renaming-and-moving-files-on-the-remote). It doesn't extend to `git checkout` or other tools that write straight to disk outside VS Code; those are still handled as a plain delete-and-create.

### Renaming and moving files on the remote

Renaming or moving something used to mean a full re-upload — for a large directory, of everything inside it. Renaming/moving is now a single remote `rename()` call, regardless of size, in two places:

**From the Remote Explorer.** Right-click a file or folder and choose **Rename**. Type a new name — including a path with `/` to move it into a subfolder — and confirm. The move is refused (with a clear message, nothing is touched) if the destination already exists, falls outside [`remotePath`](#remotepath), or would move a folder into itself.

**By dragging within the Remote Explorer.** Set [`remoteExplorer.enableDragAndDrop`](#remoteexplorer) to `true`, then drag a file or folder onto another folder in the tree to move it there — the same single `rename()` call as the **Rename** command, just started with a drag instead of a right-click. Off by default. Dragging more than one selected item asks for one confirmation covering the whole batch; a single item moves immediately. Refused, with a message, in the same cases the Rename command refuses (existing destination, moving a folder into itself or a descendant), plus a drag between two different configured roots and dragging a connection's root item itself.

**Automatically, for renames and moves made in VS Code's own Explorer.** Set `watcher.autoRename` to `true` and a rename VS Code reports — F2, drag-and-drop, cut-and-paste-as-move, all in VS Code's Explorer — is turned into the same single server-side rename instead of the delete-then-upload the watcher would otherwise do:

```json
{
  "watcher": {
    "files": "**/*",
    "autoUpload": true,
    "autoDelete": true,
    "autoRename": true
  }
}
```

A few things worth knowing:

- It only fires for renames VS Code itself reports (its Explorer, or any tool that goes through VS Code's file-rename API). A rename made by an external tool that writes straight to disk still looks like a delete-and-create to the watcher, the same as before.
- A move that crosses into a **different** configured root (a workspace with more than one `sftp.json` context) can't be a single remote rename — there's nowhere on that remote for the old path's `rename()` to reach. It falls back to a normal upload of the file at its new local path, followed by deleting the old remote path, so the two sides never disagree about the file's existence.
- Any other rename failure — a source the watcher never got around to uploading in the first place, a permissions error, a dropped connection — falls back the same way: upload the new path, *then* delete the old one, never the other order. Whatever else happens, the only remote copy is never removed before its replacement exists.
- The default is `false`. Turning it on doesn't change what `autoUpload`/`autoDelete` do for anything other than renames.

### Uploading a folder's contents without the folder itself

Set [`context`](#context) to the folder — its *contents* then map directly onto `remotePath`. Here everything in `./build` lands in `/folder1/folder2/folder3` (with only JS/HTML auto-uploaded by the watcher):

```json
{
  "name": "My Server",
  "host": "<host_ip_address>",
  "protocol": "sftp",
  "port": 22,
  "username": "user1",
  "remotePath": "/folder1/folder2/folder3",
  "context": "./build",
  "uploadOnSave": false,
  "watcher": {
    "files": "*.{js,html}",
    "autoUpload": true,
    "autoDelete": false
  }
}
```

### Configuration in User Settings (remote-fs)

Define connections once in User Settings (via [remote-fs](https://github.com/liximomo/vscode-remote-fs)) and reference them by name from any project's `sftp.json` with the [`remote`](#remote) option.

In **User Settings**:

```json
"remotefs.remote": {
  "dev": {
    "scheme": "sftp",
    "host": "host",
    "username": "username",
    "rootPath": "/path/to/somewhere"
  },
  "projectX": {
    "scheme": "sftp",
    "host": "host",
    "username": "username",
    "privateKeyPath": "/Users/xx/.ssh/id_rsa",
    "rootPath": "/home/foo/some/projectx"
  }
}
```

In **sftp.json**:

```json
{
  "remote": "dev",
  "remotePath": "/home/xx/",
  "uploadOnSave": false,
  "ignore": [".vscode", ".git", ".DS_Store"]
}
```

### Using the Remote Explorer

Open it by clicking the **SFTP** icon in the Activity Bar, or run `View: Show SFTP`.

- Browsing opens files in a **read-only** view by default. Run **`SFTP: Edit in Local`** (context menu) to download a file into the workspace for editing — or flip the [`sftp.downloadWhenOpenInRemoteExplorer`](#vs-code-extension-settings) setting to make downloading the default.
- **Multi-select** works like the regular explorer: hold `Ctrl`/`Cmd` or `Shift` while clicking to select several files/folders, then upload or download them all at once.
- Create, rename/move, and delete remote files/folders from the context menu ([file commands](#remote-explorer-and-file-commands)) — rename/move is a single remote operation regardless of size, see [Renaming and moving files](#renaming-and-moving-files-on-the-remote).
- **Drag a file or folder onto another folder** in the tree to move it there, once [`remoteExplorer.enableDragAndDrop`](#remoteexplorer) is turned on (off by default) — see [Renaming and moving files](#renaming-and-moving-files-on-the-remote).
- Hide noise (e.g. `node_modules`) with [`remoteExplorer.filesExclude`](#remoteexplorer), and control root ordering with `remoteExplorer.order`.
- **Filter** the tree with **`SFTP: Filter Remote Explorer`** (funnel icon in the view title) — typing live-narrows the tree to matching names and the folders leading to them, even inside folders you haven't opened yet. **`SFTP: Clear Filter`** resets it, and the view title shows the active query while it's on. Substring match only for now. VS Code's own `workbench.list.keyboardNavigation: filter` setting is a handy complement for searching within a folder you've already expanded.
- After a **delete**, manually refresh the parent folder if the tree doesn't update on its own (known issue).

### Monitoring and cancelling transfers

During bulk operations (folder upload/download, sync, project transfers):

- The **status bar** shows a live "Transferring X/Y files" counter, plus the combined transfer speed across every in-flight file once it's available — click the counter to cancel everything.
- The **Transfers** view in the SFTP sidebar lists each file with its status (queued / transferring / failed) and an inline **✕** button to cancel just that file.
- While a file is transferring, its row shows **byte-level progress**, current **speed**, and, once the total size is known, an **ETA** in the description — e.g. `42% — 3.1 MB / 7.4 MB — 1.2 MB/s — ETA 00:04`, or just bytes and speed when the total size isn't known. The speed and ETA are computed from a rolling window of recent progress and appear a moment into the transfer, once enough samples have been collected. Updates are throttled to a couple per second per file.
- A failed transfer keeps its row (marked *failed*) with an inline **↻ Retry** button (`sftp.retryTransfer`). Retrying re-queues just that file with its original direction and options and resets its status to *queued*.
- `SFTP: Cancel All Transfers` is also available from the Command Palette and the Transfers view title bar. It stops the directory scan as well as the queued transfers, so cancelling a large folder or project transfer takes effect immediately instead of after the whole tree has been walked.

### Comparing folders with the remote

Right-click any folder (or run **`SFTP: Compare Folders with Remote`**) to get a recursive diff against its remote counterpart. Results are grouped into **new-local**, **new-remote**, and **modified** files; picking a file offers per-file actions to open a diff, upload, or download. Use it before a sync to preview exactly what would change.

A directory that couldn't be listed on either side is reported as **Could not read** rather than being folded into the diff, and its subtree is left out entirely — nothing is known about what is inside it, so it offers no transfer actions. If the folder you are comparing can't be read at all, the command reports the error instead of showing an empty comparison.

---

## 6. Best Practices

- **Don't commit credentials.** `password` and `passphrase` are stored in plain text in `sftp.json`. Prefer key-based auth ([`privateKeyPath`](#privatekeypath) or [`agent`](#agent)), keep passwords in [secret storage](#storing-passwords-securely) via `SFTP: Save Password`, set `"passphrase": true` for a prompt instead of a stored string, and add `.vscode/sftp.json` to `.gitignore` if it contains secrets.
- **Ignore what you don't deploy.** Add `/.git`, `/.vscode`, `node_modules`, build caches, and OS junk (`.DS_Store`) to [`ignore`](#ignore) — transfers get faster and you avoid clobbering the server with noise. Use the [Force commands](#force-alt-commands) for one-off exceptions.
- **Set `maxFileSize` before running a folder upload/download or Sync on an unfamiliar project.** A stray database dump, video asset, or `.iso` in the tree otherwise transfers along with everything else, and the first sign of it is the transfer still running long after you expected it to finish. See [`maxFileSize`](#maxfilesize).
- **Protect live sites with atomic uploads.** Enable [`useTempFile`](#usetempfile) (plus [`openSsh`](#openssh) on OpenSSH servers) so a visitor never receives a half-uploaded file.
- **Pick one auto-upload mechanism.** Use either [`uploadOnSave`](#uploadonsave) or a broad [`watcher`](#watcher) (`"**/*"` with `autoUpload`), not both — doubling up causes redundant transfers.
- **Be careful with `syncOption.delete` and `watcher.autoDelete`.** They remove files on the destination. Leave [`syncConfirm`](#syncconfirm) on (its default when `delete` is enabled) to preview and confirm deletions before they happen, or run a [Compare Folders](#comparing-folders-with-the-remote) first if you're unsure what a sync will do.
- **Set `remoteTimeOffsetInHours` when clocks differ** — otherwise timestamp-based sync may copy in the wrong direction (see [`remoteTimeOffsetInHours`](#remotetimeoffsetinhours)).
- **Tune `concurrency` down for picky servers.** Shared hosts often cap concurrent SFTP operations; `"concurrency": 1–3` trades speed for reliability.
- **Verify early.** After editing `sftp.json`, run [`SFTP: Test Connection`](#verifying-your-connection) rather than discovering an auth typo mid-upload.
- **Use profiles for environments** rather than juggling multiple config files — and remember the [`… To All Profiles`](#upload-commands) commands when a release must land everywhere.

## 7. Troubleshooting and Known Issues

### Enabling debug logs

1. Open Settings (`File → Preferences → Settings`, or `Code → Preferences → Settings` on macOS).
2. Set `sftp.debug` to `true` and **reload VS Code**.
3. View the logs in `View → Output` and select the **sftp** channel.

If a connection drops mid-session, the underlying error is logged there (since 1.16.5) instead of being silently discarded.

### SSH connection error messages

As of 1.16.5, common SSH failures surface as plain-language messages instead of raw `ssh2` errors:

| Message | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Connection refused** | Nothing is listening on the configured host/port, or a firewall is blocking it. |
| **Connection timed out** | Host unreachable — wrong address, network/VPN issue, or a firewall silently dropping packets. |
| **Host not found** | Hostname couldn't be resolved; check for typos or DNS issues. |
| **Authentication failed** | Username, password, or private key was rejected by the server. |

Check the `sftp` Output channel (see [Enabling debug logs](#enabling-debug-logs)) for the underlying detail.

### FTPS transfers fail after connecting (TLS session reuse)

With `secure: true`, some servers (notably pure-ftpd) require the data connection to reuse the control connection's TLS session, which can fail under TLS 1.3 with errors like *"Client network socket disconnected before secure TLS connection was established"* on every listing or transfer, even though the connection itself succeeds. Cap the TLS version via [`secureOptions`](#secureoptions):

```json
{ "secureOptions": { "maxVersion": "TLSv1.2" } }
```

### Error: Failure

This generic message comes from the **remote** SFTP server when a syscall fails. To pinpoint it, enable debug output on the *server* side and retry. Two common causes:

1. **`remotePath` points at a symlink** — change it to the actual (resolved) path.
2. **The server ran out of file descriptors** — raise the server's descriptor limit, or if you can't, set [`limitOpenFilesOnRemote`](#limitopenfilesonremote) in `sftp.json`.

### Error: Connection closed

On legacy/old servers the connection may keep closing because of a key-exchange algorithm mismatch. Override the [`algorithms`](#algorithms) to drop `diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256` from `kex`:

```json
{
  "algorithms": {
    "kex": [
      "ecdh-sha2-nistp256",
      "ecdh-sha2-nistp384",
      "ecdh-sha2-nistp521"
    ],
    "cipher": [
      "aes128-gcm",
      "aes128-gcm@openssh.com",
      "aes256-gcm",
      "aes256-gcm@openssh.com",
      "aes128-cbc",
      "aes192-cbc",
      "aes256-cbc",
      "aes128-ctr",
      "aes192-ctr",
      "aes256-ctr"
    ],
    "serverHostKey": [
      "ssh-rsa",
      "ssh-dss",
      "ssh-ed25519",
      "ecdsa-sha2-nistp256",
      "ecdsa-sha2-nistp384",
      "ecdsa-sha2-nistp521",
      "rsa-sha2-256",
      "rsa-sha2-512"
    ],
    "hmac": [
      "hmac-sha2-256",
      "hmac-sha2-512"
    ]
  }
}
```

### ENFILE: file table overflow (macOS)

macOS has a harsh default limit on open files. Raise it:

```sh
echo kern.maxfiles=65536 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
echo kern.maxfilesperproc=65536 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=65536
sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=65536
ulimit -n 65536
```

### Upload Changed Files does nothing

Historically the command was hidden and had no shortcut (see [liximomo/vscode-sftp#854](https://github.com/liximomo/vscode-sftp/issues/854)). It is now visible in the Command Palette and Source Control view and bound to `Ctrl+Alt+U` by default. It requires a Git repository with at least one commit — it uploads files changed or created **since the last commit**.

### Remote Explorer not refreshing after delete

After deleting a remote file, the tree may not update — manually refresh the parent folder (the ↻ button or `sftp.remoteExplorer.refresh`).

### Known issues fixed in this fork

For historical context (these are already fixed on `develop`):

- **`TypeError: isDate is not a function`** from `ssh2/lib/protocol/SFTP.js` on upload/download — Node removed `util.isDate`, which `ssh2@1.13.0` still used. Fixed via `patches/ssh2+1.13.0.patch`, applied automatically by `patch-package` on `npm install`.
- Compile errors on `develop` (missing command-constant imports, `vscode-uri` default-export mismatch, `string`/`URI` type mismatch) — fixed; `npm run compile` succeeds.
- Test-suite breakage under Jest 28+ and `memfs` stream-close bugs — fixed; all suites pass.
- **Two different remotes sharing one connection** — the pooled-connection cache keyed entries by concatenating config values with no separators or key names, so configs differing only in an object-valued option (`hop`, `algorithms`, `secureOptions`) collided. Two profiles reaching the same host through different bastions reused a single connection and could transfer to the wrong server. Fixed in 1.26.3: the cache key is a digest of a canonical, key-sorted, type-tagged serialization of the connection options.
- **[`limitOpenFilesOnRemote`](#limitopenfilesonremote) broke every connection that set it** — the file-descriptor throttle reached into `sftp._stream`, an `ssh2` 0.8 internal that no longer exists since the 1.x upgrade, so enabling the option threw `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'open')` at connect time. Fixed in 1.26.3.
- **Deletions from `syncOption.delete` were fired without being awaited** — they raced the transfers into the same tree and their failures were discarded, so a sync could report success while leaving files on the remote. Fixed in 1.26.3.

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I upload the contents of a folder, but not the folder itself?**
Set [`context`](#context) to that folder (e.g. `"context": "./build"`) — its contents then map directly to `remotePath`. Full example: [Uploading a folder's contents without the folder itself](#uploading-a-folders-contents-without-the-folder-itself).

**Q: How can I upload files as root?**
A community workaround (may not work everywhere — see [liximomo/vscode-sftp#559](https://github.com/liximomo/vscode-sftp/issues/559)) is:

```json
"sshCustomParams": "sudo su -;"
```

**Q: How do I sync both ways automatically, without any user interaction?**
Use a watcher on `**/*` with `autoUpload`/`autoDelete` plus `syncOption.delete` — full config in [Two-way automatic sync with the watcher](#two-way-automatic-sync-with-the-watcher). This also keeps the server updated when Git changes files (branch checkout, revert).

**Q: Why don't I see dotfiles/hidden files in the Remote Explorer?**
Often a server-side listing setting. With **proftpd**, edit `proftpd.conf` (commonly `/etc/proftpd.conf`, `/etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf`, `/usr/local/etc/proftpd.conf`, or `/usr/local/etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf`) and change `ListOptions "-l"` to `ListOptions "-la"`:

```conf
<Global>
ListOptions "-la"
</Global>
```

**Q: Do I have to store my password in `sftp.json`?**
No — leave `password` out and you'll be prompted on connect, with an offer to remember the password in VS Code's secret storage. You can also save it up front with `SFTP: Save Password` (see [Storing passwords securely](#storing-passwords-securely)). Better yet, use key-based auth (see [Best Practices](#6-best-practices)).

**Q: What do the "Connection refused" / "Connection timed out" / "Host not found" / "Authentication failed" messages mean?**
See [SSH connection error messages](#ssh-connection-error-messages).

**Q: Can I edit files directly in the Remote Explorer?**
Files open read-only by default — use `SFTP: Edit in Local`, or set `sftp.downloadWhenOpenInRemoteExplorer` to make opening a file download it. See [Using the Remote Explorer](#using-the-remote-explorer).

**Q: Sync copies files in the wrong direction / re-uploads unchanged files.**
Sync is timestamp-based; correct clock/timezone differences with [`remoteTimeOffsetInHours`](#remotetimeoffsetinhours).

**Q: Transfers randomly fail on my shared host.**
Lower [`concurrency`](#concurrency) (some servers cap simultaneous operations) and/or set [`limitOpenFilesOnRemote`](#limitopenfilesonremote) if the server runs out of file descriptors.

**Q: Why was my rename/move refused?**
Renaming refuses rather than clobbering or guessing: the destination already exists (delete it first, or pick a different name), the new path falls outside [`remotePath`](#remotepath), or it would move a folder into its own subfolder. Nothing is touched when it's refused. See [Renaming and moving files](#renaming-and-moving-files-on-the-remote).

## 9. Development and Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome — the project is under active maintenance again at [jmwerk/SFTPresso](https://github.com/jmwerk/SFTPresso).

Development requires Node 22 or newer (see `.nvmrc`).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jmwerk/SFTPresso.git
cd SFTPresso
npm install        # applies patches (ssh2, memfs) via patch-package
npm run compile    # production build (esbuild)
npm run dev        # watch mode for development
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript type check (tsc --noEmit)
npm run lint       # ESLint
npm test           # jest unit suites (no Docker, no network)
npm run package    # build the .vsix
```

Integration tests drive the real client layers against servers in Docker — FTP
(vsftpd + pure-ftpd) and SFTP (OpenSSH). They are not part of `npm test`:

```sh
npm run test:integration:up     # generates the throwaway ssh key, starts the containers
npm run test:integration
npm run test:integration:down
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for what each suite covers.

Highlights of the codebase:

- `src/extension.ts` / `src/app.ts` — activation and wiring
- `src/commands/` — one module per command
- `src/core/` — config, file system abstractions, transfer scheduling
- `src/modules/remoteExplorer` — the Remote Explorer view
- `schema/` — the JSON schema that validates `.vscode/sftp.json`
- `patches/` — `patch-package` fixes applied on install

See also [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md).
