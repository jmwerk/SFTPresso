## 1. Overview

SFTPresso lets you add, edit, or delete files in a local directory and have those changes sync to a remote server directory over **SFTP (SSH)** or **FTP/FTPS**. The most basic setup requires only a few lines of configuration, while a wide array of options covers advanced needs — multiple servers, switchable profiles, SSH connection hopping, file watchers, and atomic uploads.

### Primary purposes

- **Remote deployment while editing locally** — keep a familiar local editor and environment and mirror your work to a web server, staging box, or embedded device on every save.
- **Remote file management** — browse, view, edit, create, and delete files on the server directly from the SFTP sidebar without leaving VS Code.
- **Directory synchronization** — one-shot or continuous sync in either (or both) directions, with fine-grained control over deletes, creates, and overwrites.
- **Multi-environment workflows** — one config with named profiles (e.g. `dev`, `prod`) or several configs mapped to different subfolders of the same workspace.

## 2. Installation and Setup

### Installing the extension

As of **v1.20.2**, every tagged release is published automatically to both the **VS Code Marketplace** and **Open VSX** by [`.github/workflows/publish.yml`](https://github.com/jmwerk/SFTPresso/blob/develop/.github/workflows/publish.yml), so you can install it straight from your editor:

1. Open the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`).
2. If you still have an older `sftp` extension installed (from `@liximomo` or `@Natizyskunk`), uninstall it first to avoid command conflicts.
3. Search for **SFTPresso** and install it — or run `ext install jmwerk.sftpresso` from the Command Palette.

Listings: [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jmwerk.sftpresso) · [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/jmwerk/sftpresso) (for VSCodium, Gitpod, Eclipse Theia, and other editors that use Open VSX).

To sideload a specific build instead, install from a VSIX package:

1. Grab a `.vsix` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jmwerk/SFTPresso/releases) — or build one from source (see [Development and Contributing](#9-development-and-contributing)).
2. In VS Code, open the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`).
3. If you still have an older `sftp` extension installed (from `@liximomo` or `@Natizyskunk`), uninstall it first to avoid command conflicts.
4. Open the **⋯ (More Actions)** menu at the top of the Extensions view and choose **Install from VSIX…**.
5. Locate the `.vsix` file and select it.
6. Reload VS Code.

To build the VSIX yourself:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jmwerk/SFTPresso.git
cd vscode-sftp
npm install          # also applies bundled patches via patch-package
npm run package      # produces sftpresso-<version>.vsix via vsce
```

### First-time setup

1. Open the local folder you want to sync (`File → Open Folder…`).
2. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`) and run **`SFTP: Config`**.
3. When no `sftp.json` exists yet, pick how to create it:
   - **Quick setup** — a guided wizard that asks for the protocol (sftp/ftp), host, port (pre-filled 22 or 21 per protocol), username, authentication method, remote path, and whether to upload on save. For SFTP the auth choices are a password prompt at connect time (with an offer to remember it in secret storage), a private key file (`~` is expanded and the file is checked to exist), or a running ssh-agent. Answers are validated against the config schema, `sftp.json` is written, and **`SFTP: Test Connection`** runs immediately to confirm the connection works.
   - **Edit JSON** — the extension creates `.vscode/sftp.json` with a starter template. Edit it with your server details:

```json
{
    "name": "My Server",
    "host": "server.example.com",
    "protocol": "sftp",
    "port": 22,
    "username": "user1",
    "remotePath": "/var/www/project",
    "uploadOnSave": false
}
```

4. Save and close `sftp.json`. The extension activates automatically whenever a workspace contains `.vscode/sftp.json`.
5. Type `SFTP` in the Command Palette to see all available commands (see the [Command Reference](#3-command-reference)). Many are also available from the file explorer and editor context menus.

Notes:

- `password` is optional — if omitted you'll be prompted when a connection is made, and offered to have the password remembered in VS Code's secret storage (see [Storing passwords securely](#storing-passwords-securely)). If you do store it in `sftp.json`, be aware it is **plain text** (see [Best Practices](#6-best-practices)).
- Backslashes and other special characters in JSON values must be escaped with a backslash.
- `sftp.json` gets schema-validated in the editor, so you get completions and warnings for unknown or mistyped option names.

### Verifying your connection

Run **`SFTP: Test Connection`** from the Command Palette, or click the **Test Connection** CodeLens shown at the top of `sftp.json`. It connects using the active profile's settings and reports success or failure with an actionable message (see [SSH connection error messages](#ssh-connection-error-messages)).

A **connection-status indicator** in the status bar reflects the live state of the remote connection at a glance: a plug icon when idle, a spinner while connecting or reconnecting, an active-VM icon when connected, and an error icon (with a highlighted background) when a connection fails. Because connections reconnect lazily on the next operation, this makes silent reconnects and authentication failures visible. Clicking it runs **`SFTP: Test Connection`**.

### Storing passwords securely

Instead of writing `password` into `sftp.json` (which is plain text), you can keep it in VS Code's secret storage, which is backed by the operating system keychain:

- Run **`SFTP: Save Password`**, pick the remote, and enter the password. Future connections use it automatically — no prompt, nothing in `sftp.json`.
- Or just connect: when you're prompted for a password and the connection succeeds, the extension offers to **remember** it.
- Run **`SFTP: Clear Password`** to delete a saved password (for example after it changed on the server).

Saved passwords are keyed by `protocol://username@host:port`, so each server/user pair is stored independently (configs and profiles that point at the same server share one saved password). A saved password is only used when the config provides no other authentication — configs that set `password`, `privateKeyPath`, `agent`, or `interactiveAuth` behave exactly as before. If `sftp.json` still contains a plaintext `password`, the extension logs a one-time reminder in the output channel.

## 3. Command Reference

All commands live under the **SFTP** category in the Command Palette. Most are also exposed via context menus (file explorer, editor, editor title, SCM view, Remote Explorer). Commands are only available when the extension is active (workspace contains `.vscode/sftp.json`).

### Configuration and connection commands

| Command | ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SFTP: Config` | `sftp.config` | Create a new `sftp.json` for the workspace — via a guided quick-setup wizard or a starter template — or open the existing one. See [First-time setup](#first-time-setup). |
| `SFTP: Set Profile` | `sftp.setProfile` | Switch the active [profile](#profiles-dev--prod). |
| `SFTP: Test Connection` | `sftp.testConnection` | Connect to the active profile's remote and report success/failure. Also available as a CodeLens on `sftp.json`. |
| `SFTP: Toggle Upload on Save` | `sftp.toggleUploadOnSave` | Flip the active config's [`uploadOnSave`](#uploadonsave) and write it back to `sftp.json` (comments and formatting preserved). The status bar shows a `$(cloud-upload)` indicator while it's on. |
| Add to Ignore | `sftp.addToIgnore` | File-explorer context menu command. Appends the right-clicked file or folder's workspace-relative path to the active config's [`ignore`](#ignore) array in `sftp.json` (folders as `path/**`), preserving comments and formatting; a no-op if the entry is already listed. |
| `SFTP: Open SSH in Terminal` | `sftp.openConnectInTerminal` | Open a VS Code terminal auto-logged-in to the server. Extra CLI flags can be added via [`sshCustomParams`](#sshcustomparams). |
| `SFTP: Save Password` | `sftp.savePassword` | Store a password for a remote in VS Code's secret storage (OS keychain). See [Storing passwords securely](#storing-passwords-securely). |
| `SFTP: Clear Password` | `sftp.clearPassword` | Remove a saved password from secret storage. |

### Upload commands

Uploads overwrite the remote copy unconditionally. Enable [`conflictCheck`](#conflictcheck) to be warned first when the remote file changed since you last downloaded or uploaded it.

| Command | ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SFTP: Upload Active File` | `sftp.upload.activeFile` | Upload the file currently open in the editor. |
| `SFTP: Upload Active Folder` | `sftp.upload.activeFolder` | Upload the folder containing the current file. |
| `SFTP: Upload Project` | `sftp.upload.project` | Upload the whole project (respecting [`ignore`](#ignore) rules). |
| `SFTP: Upload Changed Files` | `sftp.upload.changedFiles` | Upload all files changed or created since the last Git commit (including deletions). Default keybinding `Ctrl+Alt+U`; also shown in the Source Control view. |
| Upload File / Upload Folder | `sftp.upload.file` / `sftp.upload.folder` | Context-menu variants that act on the right-clicked explorer item. |
| `SFTP: Upload … To All Profiles` | `sftp.upload.activeFile.to.allProfiles`, `sftp.upload.activeFolder.to.allProfiles`, `sftp.upload.project.to.allProfiles`, `sftp.upload.file.to.allProfiles`, `sftp.upload.folder.to.allProfiles` | Same as above but pushes to **every** profile defined in the config, not just the active one. |

### Download commands

| Command | ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SFTP: Download Active File` | `sftp.download.activeFile` | Download the remote version of the current file, overwriting the local copy. |
| `SFTP: Download Active Folder` | `sftp.download.activeFolder` | Download the folder containing the current file. |
| `SFTP: Download Project` | `sftp.download.project` | Download everything under [`remotePath`](#remotepath) into the workspace. |
| Download File / Download Folder | `sftp.download.file` / `sftp.download.folder` | Context-menu variants (explorer and Remote Explorer). |

### Sync commands

Sync compares timestamps and transfers only what differs; behavior is tuned with [`syncOption`](#syncoption). Enable [`syncConfirm`](#syncconfirm) to preview and confirm exactly what a sync will upload, overwrite, and delete before it runs.

| Command | ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SFTP: Sync Local -> Remote` | `sftp.sync.localToRemote` | Copies files that differ by timestamp, plus files that exist only locally. |
| `SFTP: Sync Remote -> Local` | `sftp.sync.remoteToLocal` | Same, in the opposite direction. |
| `SFTP: Sync Both Directions` | `sftp.sync.bothDirections` | Compares modification times and always keeps the **newest** version on both sides. Only `syncOption.skipCreate` and `syncOption.ignoreExisting` apply to this command. |

> If local and remote clocks disagree (server in another timezone, clock drift), set [`remoteTimeOffsetInHours`](#remotetimeoffsetinhours) so timestamp comparison stays accurate.

### Diff and compare commands

| Command | ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SFTP: Diff Active File with Remote` | `sftp.diff.activeFile` | Open VS Code's diff view: current file vs. its remote counterpart. |
| Diff with Remote | `sftp.diff` | Context-menu variant for any explorer file. |
| `SFTP: Compare Folders with Remote` | `sftp.compareFolders` | Recursively diffs a local folder against its remote counterpart; results (new-local / new-remote / modified) are listed in a QuickPick with per-file actions to open a diff, upload, or download. |

### Remote Explorer and file commands

| Command | ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SFTP: List` / `SFTP: List Active Folder` / `SFTP: List All` | `sftp.list` / `sftp.listActiveFolder` / `sftp.listAll` | List remote directory contents in a QuickPick. `List All` includes ignored files. |
| Delete | `sftp.delete.remote` | Delete the selected file/folder **on the remote** (Remote Explorer context menu). |
| Create Folder / Create File | `sftp.create.folder` / `sftp.create.file` | Create a remote folder or file from the Remote Explorer. |
| Edit in Local | `sftp.remoteExplorer.editInLocal` | Download the remote file into the workspace so it can be edited (Remote Explorer opens files read-only by default). |
| View Content | `sftp.viewContent` | Open a read-only view of a remote file. |
| Reveal in Explorer | `sftp.revealInExplorer` | Jump from a remote file to its local counterpart in the file explorer. |
| Reveal in Remote Explorer | `sftp.revealInRemoteExplorer` | Jump from a local file to its remote counterpart in the Remote Explorer. |
| Refresh | `sftp.remoteExplorer.refresh` | Refresh the Remote Explorer tree. |
| Refresh Active Remote File | `sftp.remoteExplorer.refreshActiveFile` | Re-fetch the remote file open in the editor. |

### Transfer management commands

| Command | ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SFTP: Cancel All Transfers` | `sftp.cancelAllTransfer` | Stop every in-flight upload/download. Also triggered by clicking the status-bar progress counter, and from the Transfers view title bar. |
| Cancel Transfer | `sftp.cancelTransfer` | Cancel a single in-flight file — the inline ✕ button on items in the [Transfers view](#monitoring-and-cancelling-transfers). |
| Retry Transfer | `sftp.retryTransfer` | Re-queue a single failed file — the inline ↻ button on failed items in the [Transfers view](#monitoring-and-cancelling-transfers). |

### Force (Alt) commands

Hold **Alt** while a context menu is open to reveal the force variants, which **disregard [`ignore`](#ignore) rules**:

| Command | ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Force Upload | `sftp.forceUpload` | Upload even files matched by ignore rules. |
| Force Download | `sftp.forceDownload` | Download even files matched by ignore rules. |
| Force Upload To All Profiles | `sftp.forceUpload.to.allProfiles` | Force-upload to every profile. |

### Commands with keybinding arguments

These accept arguments when bound in `keybindings.json` or invoked from `tasks.json`:

| Command | Signature |
| --- | --- |
| `sftp.setProfile` | `func(profileName: string)` |
| `sftp.upload` | `func(fspaths: string[])` — upload the given files/folders |
| `sftp.download` | `func(fspaths: string[])` — download the given files/folders |

Example — a keybinding that switches straight to the `prod` profile:

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+alt+p",
  "command": "sftp.setProfile",
  "args": "prod"
}
```

### Default keybindings

| Keys | Command | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+Alt+U` | `SFTP: Upload Changed Files` | Extension active |

---

## 4. Configuration Reference (`sftp.json`)

Configuration lives in `<workspace>/.vscode/sftp.json` — either a single object, or an **array of objects** for [multiple contexts](#multiple-contexts-array-config). Open it any time via `SFTP: Config`.

The file is read as **JSONC**: `// line comments`, `/* block comments */`, and trailing commas are all allowed, so you can annotate a config or comment out options without breaking it. Parse errors are reported with their line and column.

### Common options

Apply to both SFTP and FTP unless noted.

#### name
A string to identify your configuration. Shown in pickers when multiple configs exist. **Required when using an array (multi-context) config.**

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | — |

```json
{ "name": "My Server" }
```

#### context
A path relative to the workspace root. Use it to map a **subfolder** (rather than the whole workspace) to `remotePath`. Only available at the root level of a config (not inside profiles).

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `context` | string | workspace root |

```json
{ "context": "./build" }
```

#### protocol
Transfer protocol.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `protocol` | `"sftp"` \| `"ftp"` | `"sftp"` |

#### host
Hostname or IP address of the server.

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `host` | string |

#### port
Server port. Typically `22` for SFTP, `21` for FTP, `990` for implicit FTPS.

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `port` | integer |

#### username
Username for authentication.

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `username` | string |

#### password
Password for password-based authentication. **Optional** — omit it to use a password saved via `SFTP: Save Password`, or to be prompted at connect time (see [Storing passwords securely](#storing-passwords-securely)).

> ⚠️ **Warning:** passwords in `sftp.json` are stored as **plain text**. Prefer [`privateKeyPath`](#privatekeypath) or [`agent`](#agent) — or keep the password in [secret storage](#storing-passwords-securely) — and keep `sftp.json` out of version control. See [Best Practices](#6-best-practices).

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `password` | string |

#### remotePath
The absolute path on the remote host that maps to your local [`context`](#context). This is what `SFTP: Download Project` downloads.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `remotePath` | string | `/` |

#### filePerm
Octal permissions applied to newly created remote files.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `filePerm` | number | unset |

```json
{ "filePerm": 644 }
```

#### dirPerm
Octal permissions applied to newly created remote directories.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dirPerm` | number | unset |

```json
{ "dirPerm": 750 }
```

#### uploadOnSave
Upload the file on every VS Code save. See the [Upload on save](#upload-on-save) workflow. You can flip this without editing JSON via **`SFTP: Toggle Upload on Save`**; the status bar shows a `$(cloud-upload)` indicator while it's on.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `uploadOnSave` | boolean | `false` |

#### useTempFile
Upload to a temporary file first, then move it into place — avoids serving a half-written file to visitors while the upload is in progress.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `useTempFile` | boolean | `false` |

#### openSsh
Enable **atomic** file uploads (rename-into-place). Only supported by OpenSSH servers.

> 💡 If `openSsh` is `true`, [`useTempFile`](#usetempfile) must also be `true`.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openSsh` | boolean | `false` |

```json
{ "openSsh": true, "useTempFile": true }
```

#### downloadOnOpen
Download the remote version of a file whenever it is opened locally.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `downloadOnOpen` | boolean | `false` |

#### syncOption
Tunes the [Sync commands](#sync-commands).

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `syncOption` | object | `{}` |

| Sub-option | Type | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `syncOption.delete` | boolean | Delete extraneous files from the destination. |
| `syncOption.skipCreate` | boolean | Don't create files that are new to the destination. |
| `syncOption.ignoreExisting` | boolean | Don't update files that already exist on the destination. |
| `syncOption.update` | boolean | Only overwrite the destination if the source copy is newer. |

```json
{
  "syncOption": {
    "delete": true,
    "skipCreate": false,
    "ignoreExisting": false,
    "update": true
  }
}
```

> `Sync Both Directions` honors only `skipCreate` and `ignoreExisting`.

#### syncConfirm
Show a dry-run preview before a [Sync command](#sync-commands) runs. The extension walks the local/remote diff, computes exactly what the sync would do — respecting [`syncOption`](#syncoption) — and shows a modal summary such as *"Sync Local → Remote: 3 uploads, 1 overwrite, 2 deletions. Proceed?"* with the affected files listed. **Cancel** leaves everything untouched; **Proceed** runs the sync unchanged. If nothing differs, an info message is shown and no sync runs.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `syncConfirm` | boolean | `true` when [`syncOption.delete`](#syncoption) is enabled, otherwise `false` |

The default is deliberately conservative: syncs that can delete files on the destination prompt by default, while non-destructive syncs don't. Set it explicitly to always (or never) confirm.

```json
{
  "syncConfirm": true
}
```

#### conflictCheck
Guard against uploads that would silently overwrite someone else's work. Before a file upload replaces an existing remote file, the extension checks whether the remote copy changed since you last downloaded or uploaded it. If it did, a modal shows both timestamps and offers **Overwrite**, **Open Diff**, or **Cancel** — **Open Diff** opens the local/remote [diff](#diff-and-compare-commands) and leaves the remote untouched.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `conflictCheck` | boolean | `false` |

```json
{
  "uploadOnSave": true,
  "conflictCheck": true
}
```

This is not just a local-vs-remote timestamp comparison. After each transfer of a file, the extension records what the remote looked like at that moment, and compares the remote against *that*. It matters because once you edit a file locally, your local copy is the newest one — so a plain timestamp check would call the upload safe even when a teammate changed the remote in the meantime. Until a file has a recorded baseline (nothing has been transferred yet this workspace), the check falls back to flagging a remote that is newer than your local copy.

Scope and caveats:

- Applies to **single-file uploads**, including [`uploadOnSave`](#uploadonsave). Folder uploads and the [Sync commands](#sync-commands) are not checked — a folder upload would mean prompting per file mid-transfer; use [`syncConfirm`](#syncconfirm) to review a whole tree before it runs.
- Enabling it costs one extra `stat` round-trip per file transfer (to read the remote back). It is off by default partly for that reason.
- Baselines are remembered per workspace. Uploading the same file from a **second machine** leaves the first machine's baseline stale, so the next upload there may prompt once; choose **Overwrite** and it re-syncs.
- On FTP servers that cannot set a file's modification time (no `MFMT`), the remote mtime is the upload time rather than your file's, which makes conflicts likelier to be reported. See [`remoteTimeOffsetInHours`](#remotetimeoffsetinhours) if local and remote clocks disagree.

#### ignore
Files/folders excluded from transfers and sync. Gitignore-style patterns (wildcards with `*`), relative to the config's [`context`](#context). Bypass with the [Force commands](#force-alt-commands).

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ignore` | string[] | `[]` |

```json
{
  "ignore": [
    "/.vscode",
    "/.git",
    ".DS_Store",
    "*.log"
  ]
}
```

#### ignoreFile
Path to an ignore file (e.g. `.gitignore`-style list) — absolute, or relative to the workspace root.

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `ignoreFile` | string |

```json
{ "ignoreFile": ".gitignore" }
```

#### watcher
Watches for file changes made **outside** the VS Code editor (build output, `git checkout`, external tools) and reacts automatically. Only available at the root level of a config (not inside profiles). See [Two-way automatic sync](#two-way-automatic-sync-with-the-watcher).

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `watcher` | object | `{}` |

| Sub-option | Type | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `watcher.files` | string (glob) | Which files to watch (required). |
| `watcher.autoUpload` | boolean | Upload when a watched file changes. |
| `watcher.autoDelete` | boolean | Delete on the remote when a watched file is removed locally. |

> 💡 Set [`uploadOnSave`](#uploadonsave) to `false` when watching everything (`"**/*"`) — otherwise every save triggers both mechanisms.

```json
{
  "watcher": {
    "files": "dist/*.{js,css}",
    "autoUpload": true,
    "autoDelete": false
  }
}
```

#### remoteTimeOffsetInHours
Hours of clock difference between the remote server and your machine (**remote minus local**). Needed for accurate timestamp-based [sync](#sync-commands) when the server is in another timezone or its clock drifts.

> **FTP note:** servers that support the `MLSD` command (e.g. pure-ftpd, ProFTPD) report exact UTC timestamps, so this option should normally stay `0` for them. It's mainly needed for FTP servers limited to `LIST` (e.g. vsftpd), whose listings carry only server-local, minute-precision dates, and for SFTP servers with a skewed clock.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `remoteTimeOffsetInHours` | number | `0` |

#### remoteExplorer
Tunes the [Remote Explorer](#using-the-remote-explorer) view.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `remoteExplorer` | object | `{}` |

| Sub-option | Type | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `remoteExplorer.filesExclude` | string[] | Patterns for files/folders to hide in the Remote Explorer. |
| `remoteExplorer.order` | number | Sort position of this config among Remote Explorer roots (default `0`). |

```json
{
  "remoteExplorer": {
    "filesExclude": ["**/node_modules"],
    "order": 1
  }
}
```

#### concurrency
Maximum simultaneous transfers. Lower it if your server limits concurrent connections/operations.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `concurrency` | number | `4` |

#### connectTimeout
Maximum time (ms) to wait when establishing a connection.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `connectTimeout` | number | `10000` |

#### limitOpenFilesOnRemote
Cap the number of file descriptors opened on the remote server. Set `true` for the default limit (222), or a number for a custom limit. Use it if transfers fail with the generic [`Error: Failure`](#error-failure) because the server runs out of descriptors.

> 💡 **Do not set this unless you have to.**

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `limitOpenFilesOnRemote` | boolean \| number | `false` |

#### profiles
A collection of named profiles keyed by profile name. Each profile is merged over the top-level config; switch with `SFTP: Set Profile`. See [Profiles (dev / prod)](#profiles-dev--prod).

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `profiles` | object |
| `defaultProfile` | string — profile activated by default |

#### remote
Reference a connection defined in User Settings under `remotefs.remote` instead of repeating host details per project. See [Configuration in User Settings](#configuration-in-user-settings-remote-fs).

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `remote` | string |

### SFTP-only options

#### agent
Path to the ssh-agent UNIX socket for agent-based authentication (usually `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`). Windows users: set to `pageant` to authenticate with Pageant, or the path to a Cygwin "UNIX socket".

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `agent` | string |

```json
{ "agent": "/run/user/1000/ssh-agent.socket" }
```

#### privateKeyPath
Absolute path to your private key file.

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `privateKeyPath` | string |

```json
{ "privateKeyPath": "/Users/me/.ssh/id_rsa" }
```

#### passphrase
Passphrase for an encrypted private key. Set the string itself, or set `true` to be prompted with a dialog (keeps the passphrase out of the config file — recommended).

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `passphrase` | string \| boolean |

```json
{ "passphrase": true }
```

#### interactiveAuth
Enable keyboard-interactive authentication (e.g. multi-factor / Google Authenticator). Set `true` for a verification-code dialog, or pass an array of predefined responses to answer prompts automatically.

> 💡 Requires the server to have keyboard-interactive authentication enabled.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `interactiveAuth` | boolean \| string[] | `false` |

```json
{ "interactiveAuth": true }
```

#### algorithms
Explicit overrides for the SSH transport-layer algorithms. Mainly needed for older servers — see [Error: Connection closed](#error-connection-closed).

Default:

```json
{
  "algorithms": {
    "kex": [
      "ecdh-sha2-nistp256",
      "ecdh-sha2-nistp384",
      "ecdh-sha2-nistp521",
      "diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256"
    ],
    "cipher": [
      "aes128-gcm",
      "aes128-gcm@openssh.com",
      "aes256-gcm",
      "aes256-gcm@openssh.com",
      "aes128-cbc",
      "aes192-cbc",
      "aes256-cbc",
      "aes128-ctr",
      "aes192-ctr",
      "aes256-ctr"
    ],
    "serverHostKey": [
      "ssh-rsa",
      "ssh-dss",
      "ssh-ed25519",
      "ecdsa-sha2-nistp256",
      "ecdsa-sha2-nistp384",
      "ecdsa-sha2-nistp521",
      "rsa-sha2-512",
      "rsa-sha2-256"
    ],
    "hmac": [
      "hmac-sha2-256",
      "hmac-sha2-512"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### sshConfigPath
Path to your OpenSSH client config file; matching `Host` entries contribute settings to the connection.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sshConfigPath` | string | `~/.ssh/config` |

#### sshCustomParams
Extra parameters appended to the `ssh` command used by `SFTP: Open SSH in Terminal`.

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `sshCustomParams` | string |

```json
{ "sshCustomParams": "-g" }
```

#### hop
Connect through one or more intermediate SSH hosts. A single object for one hop, or an array for multiple. See [Connection hopping](#connection-hopping-ssh-proxy--bastion). Each hop accepts the same host/auth options (`host`, `port`, `username`, `privateKeyPath`, …).

> Variable substitution does not work inside a hop configuration.

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `hop` | object \| object[] |

### FTP(S)-only options

#### secure
Connection encryption mode:

- `true` — encrypt both control and data connections (explicit FTPS)
- `"control"` — encrypt the control connection only
- `"implicit"` — implicitly encrypted control connection (legacy; usually port 990)

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `secure` | boolean \| `"control"` \| `"implicit"` | `false` |

```json
{ "protocol": "ftp", "port": 21, "secure": true }
```

#### secureOptions
Extra options passed straight to Node's [`tls.connect()`](https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback) — e.g. to accept a self-signed certificate.

| Key | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `secureOptions` | object |

```json
{ "secureOptions": { "rejectUnauthorized": false } }
```

### VS Code extension settings

These are regular VS Code settings (`File → Preferences → Settings`, or `settings.json`), separate from `sftp.json`:

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sftp.debug` | boolean | `false` | Print debug output to the `sftp` Output channel. **Reload VS Code after changing.** |
| `sftp.printDebugLog` | boolean | `false` | Legacy alias for the same debug output. |
| `sftp.downloadWhenOpenInRemoteExplorer` | boolean | `false` | When opening a file in the Remote Explorer, download it ("Edit in Local") instead of showing a read-only "View Content". |

---

## 5. Usage Examples and Common Workflows

### Simple single-server setup

The minimum viable config — SFTP on port 22, prompted for the password:

```json
{
  "host": "host",
  "username": "username",
  "remotePath": "/remote/workspace"
}
```

### Start from a remote project

If the latest files already live on the server, start with an **empty local folder**:

1. Open the empty folder in VS Code and run `SFTP: Config` (see [First-time setup](#first-time-setup)).
2. Set `remotePath` to the server directory you want.
3. Run **`SFTP: Download Project`** — the remote tree is downloaded into your workspace.
4. From here on, edit locally and upload/sync as needed.

### Upload on save

Mirror every save to the server:

```json
{
  "host": "server.example.com",
  "username": "deploy",
  "remotePath": "/var/www/site",
  "uploadOnSave": true
}
```

If your site is live, add temp-file/atomic uploads so visitors never see a half-written file:

```json
{
  "uploadOnSave": true,
  "useTempFile": true,
  "openSsh": true
}
```

(See [`useTempFile`](#usetempfile) and [`openSsh`](#openssh).)

If others deploy to the same server, add [`conflictCheck`](#conflictcheck) so a save can't quietly overwrite a change you never pulled down:

```json
{
  "uploadOnSave": true,
  "conflictCheck": true
}
```

### Profiles (dev / prod)

One config, several environments. Profile values merge over the top-level config; switch with **`SFTP: Set Profile`**.

When a config defines profiles, the status bar item shows the active profile (e.g. **`SFTP: dev`**, or **`SFTP: (no profile)`** when none is active), and clicking it opens the profile picker — same as running `SFTP: Set Profile`. Without profiles, the status bar keeps its usual behavior (shows `SFTP`, click to toggle the output panel).

```json
{
  "username": "username",
  "password": "password",
  "remotePath": "/remote/workspace/a",
  "watcher": {
    "files": "dist/*.{js,css}",
    "autoUpload": false,
    "autoDelete": false
  },
  "profiles": {
    "dev": {
      "host": "dev-host",
      "remotePath": "/dev",
      "uploadOnSave": true
    },
    "prod": {
      "host": "prod-host",
      "remotePath": "/prod"
    }
  },
  "defaultProfile": "dev"
}
```

> `context` and `watcher` are only available at the root level, not inside a profile.

To deploy to every environment at once, use the **`… To All Profiles`** [upload commands](#upload-commands).

### Multiple contexts (array config)

Map different workspace subfolders to different servers (or different remote paths). The `context` values must differ, and `name` is **required**:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "server1",
    "context": "project/build",
    "host": "host",
    "username": "username",
    "password": "password",
    "remotePath": "/remote/project/build"
  },
  {
    "name": "server2",
    "context": "project/src",
    "host": "host",
    "username": "username",
    "password": "password",
    "remotePath": "/remote/project/src"
  }
]
```

### Connection hopping (SSH proxy / bastion)

Reach a target server through an intermediate host with the SSH protocol. Note: variable substitution does not work in a hop configuration.

**Single hop** (`local → hop → target`):

```json
{
  "name": "target",
  "remotePath": "/path/in/target",

  "host": "hopHost",
  "username": "hopUsername",
  "privateKeyPath": "/Users/localUser/.ssh/id_rsa",

  "hop": {
    "host": "targetHost",
    "username": "targetUsername",
    "privateKeyPath": "/Users/hopUser/.ssh/id_rsa"
  }
}
```

The top-level `privateKeyPath` is a file **on your local machine**; the one inside `hop` is a file **on the hop host**.

**Multiple hops** (`local → hopA → hopB → target`): make `hop` an array — each entry authenticates from the previous host, and the last entry is the target:

```json
{
  "name": "target",
  "remotePath": "/path/in/target",

  "host": "hopAHost",
  "username": "hopAUsername",
  "privateKeyPath": "/Users/localUser/.ssh/id_rsa",

  "hop": [
    {
      "host": "hopBHost",
      "username": "hopBUsername",
      "privateKeyPath": "/Users/hopAUser/.ssh/id_rsa"
    },
    {
      "host": "targetHost",
      "username": "targetUsername",
      "privateKeyPath": "/Users/hopBUser/.ssh/id_rsa"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Two-way automatic sync with the watcher

Keep the server updated with **no manual interaction** — including changes made outside VS Code, e.g. when Git checks out a branch or reverts commits:

```json
{
  "name": "My Server",
  "host": "<host_ip_address>",
  "protocol": "sftp",
  "port": 22,
  "username": "user1",
  "remotePath": "/folder1/folder2/folder3",
  "uploadOnSave": false,
  "watcher": {
    "files": "**/*",
    "autoUpload": true,
    "autoDelete": true
  },
  "syncOption": {
    "delete": true
  }
}
```

Keep `uploadOnSave` **false** here — the watcher already covers saves when watching `**/*` (see [`watcher`](#watcher)).

### Uploading a folder's contents without the folder itself

Set [`context`](#context) to the folder — its *contents* then map directly onto `remotePath`. Here everything in `./build` lands in `/folder1/folder2/folder3` (with only JS/HTML auto-uploaded by the watcher):

```json
{
  "name": "My Server",
  "host": "<host_ip_address>",
  "protocol": "sftp",
  "port": 22,
  "username": "user1",
  "remotePath": "/folder1/folder2/folder3",
  "context": "./build",
  "uploadOnSave": false,
  "watcher": {
    "files": "*.{js,html}",
    "autoUpload": true,
    "autoDelete": false
  }
}
```

### Configuration in User Settings (remote-fs)

Define connections once in User Settings (via [remote-fs](https://github.com/liximomo/vscode-remote-fs)) and reference them by name from any project's `sftp.json` with the [`remote`](#remote) option.

In **User Settings**:

```json
"remotefs.remote": {
  "dev": {
    "scheme": "sftp",
    "host": "host",
    "username": "username",
    "rootPath": "/path/to/somewhere"
  },
  "projectX": {
    "scheme": "sftp",
    "host": "host",
    "username": "username",
    "privateKeyPath": "/Users/xx/.ssh/id_rsa",
    "rootPath": "/home/foo/some/projectx"
  }
}
```

In **sftp.json**:

```json
{
  "remote": "dev",
  "remotePath": "/home/xx/",
  "uploadOnSave": false,
  "ignore": [".vscode", ".git", ".DS_Store"]
}
```

### Using the Remote Explorer

Open it by clicking the **SFTP** icon in the Activity Bar, or run `View: Show SFTP`.

- Browsing opens files in a **read-only** view by default. Run **`SFTP: Edit in Local`** (context menu) to download a file into the workspace for editing — or flip the [`sftp.downloadWhenOpenInRemoteExplorer`](#vs-code-extension-settings) setting to make downloading the default.
- **Multi-select** works like the regular explorer: hold `Ctrl`/`Cmd` or `Shift` while clicking to select several files/folders, then upload or download them all at once.
- Create and delete remote files/folders from the context menu ([file commands](#remote-explorer-and-file-commands)).
- Hide noise (e.g. `node_modules`) with [`remoteExplorer.filesExclude`](#remoteexplorer), and control root ordering with `remoteExplorer.order`.
- After a **delete**, manually refresh the parent folder if the tree doesn't update on its own (known issue).

### Monitoring and cancelling transfers

During bulk operations (folder upload/download, sync, project transfers):

- The **status bar** shows a live "Transferring X/Y files" counter — click it to cancel everything.
- The **Transfers** view in the SFTP sidebar lists each file with its status (queued / transferring / failed) and an inline **✕** button to cancel just that file.
- While a file is transferring, its row shows **byte-level progress** in the description — e.g. `42% — 3.1 MB / 7.4 MB`, or just the bytes transferred when the total size isn't known. Updates are throttled to a couple per second per file.
- A failed transfer keeps its row (marked *failed*) with an inline **↻ Retry** button (`sftp.retryTransfer`). Retrying re-queues just that file with its original direction and options and resets its status to *queued*.
- `SFTP: Cancel All Transfers` is also available from the Command Palette and the Transfers view title bar.

### Comparing folders with the remote

Right-click any folder (or run **`SFTP: Compare Folders with Remote`**) to get a recursive diff against its remote counterpart. Results are grouped into **new-local**, **new-remote**, and **modified** files; picking a file offers per-file actions to open a diff, upload, or download. Use it before a sync to preview exactly what would change.

---

## 6. Best Practices

- **Don't commit credentials.** `password` and `passphrase` are stored in plain text in `sftp.json`. Prefer key-based auth ([`privateKeyPath`](#privatekeypath) or [`agent`](#agent)), keep passwords in [secret storage](#storing-passwords-securely) via `SFTP: Save Password`, set `"passphrase": true` for a prompt instead of a stored string, and add `.vscode/sftp.json` to `.gitignore` if it contains secrets.
- **Ignore what you don't deploy.** Add `/.git`, `/.vscode`, `node_modules`, build caches, and OS junk (`.DS_Store`) to [`ignore`](#ignore) — transfers get faster and you avoid clobbering the server with noise. Use the [Force commands](#force-alt-commands) for one-off exceptions.
- **Protect live sites with atomic uploads.** Enable [`useTempFile`](#usetempfile) (plus [`openSsh`](#openssh) on OpenSSH servers) so a visitor never receives a half-uploaded file.
- **Pick one auto-upload mechanism.** Use either [`uploadOnSave`](#uploadonsave) or a broad [`watcher`](#watcher) (`"**/*"` with `autoUpload`), not both — doubling up causes redundant transfers.
- **Be careful with `syncOption.delete` and `watcher.autoDelete`.** They remove files on the destination. Leave [`syncConfirm`](#syncconfirm) on (its default when `delete` is enabled) to preview and confirm deletions before they happen, or run a [Compare Folders](#comparing-folders-with-the-remote) first if you're unsure what a sync will do.
- **Set `remoteTimeOffsetInHours` when clocks differ** — otherwise timestamp-based sync may copy in the wrong direction (see [`remoteTimeOffsetInHours`](#remotetimeoffsetinhours)).
- **Tune `concurrency` down for picky servers.** Shared hosts often cap concurrent SFTP operations; `"concurrency": 1–3` trades speed for reliability.
- **Verify early.** After editing `sftp.json`, run [`SFTP: Test Connection`](#verifying-your-connection) rather than discovering an auth typo mid-upload.
- **Use profiles for environments** rather than juggling multiple config files — and remember the [`… To All Profiles`](#upload-commands) commands when a release must land everywhere.

## 7. Troubleshooting and Known Issues

### Enabling debug logs

1. Open Settings (`File → Preferences → Settings`, or `Code → Preferences → Settings` on macOS).
2. Set `sftp.debug` to `true` and **reload VS Code**.
3. View the logs in `View → Output` and select the **sftp** channel.

If a connection drops mid-session, the underlying error is logged there (since 1.16.5) instead of being silently discarded.

### SSH connection error messages

As of 1.16.5, common SSH failures surface as plain-language messages instead of raw `ssh2` errors:

| Message | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Connection refused** | Nothing is listening on the configured host/port, or a firewall is blocking it. |
| **Connection timed out** | Host unreachable — wrong address, network/VPN issue, or a firewall silently dropping packets. |
| **Host not found** | Hostname couldn't be resolved; check for typos or DNS issues. |
| **Authentication failed** | Username, password, or private key was rejected by the server. |

Check the `sftp` Output channel (see [Enabling debug logs](#enabling-debug-logs)) for the underlying detail.

### FTPS transfers fail after connecting (TLS session reuse)

With `secure: true`, some servers (notably pure-ftpd) require the data connection to reuse the control connection's TLS session, which can fail under TLS 1.3 with errors like *"Client network socket disconnected before secure TLS connection was established"* on every listing or transfer, even though the connection itself succeeds. Cap the TLS version via [`secureOptions`](#secureoptions):

```json
{ "secureOptions": { "maxVersion": "TLSv1.2" } }
```

### Error: Failure

This generic message comes from the **remote** SFTP server when a syscall fails. To pinpoint it, enable debug output on the *server* side and retry. Two common causes:

1. **`remotePath` points at a symlink** — change it to the actual (resolved) path.
2. **The server ran out of file descriptors** — raise the server's descriptor limit, or if you can't, set [`limitOpenFilesOnRemote`](#limitopenfilesonremote) in `sftp.json`.

### Error: Connection closed

On legacy/old servers the connection may keep closing because of a key-exchange algorithm mismatch. Override the [`algorithms`](#algorithms) to drop `diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256` from `kex`:

```json
{
  "algorithms": {
    "kex": [
      "ecdh-sha2-nistp256",
      "ecdh-sha2-nistp384",
      "ecdh-sha2-nistp521"
    ],
    "cipher": [
      "aes128-gcm",
      "aes128-gcm@openssh.com",
      "aes256-gcm",
      "aes256-gcm@openssh.com",
      "aes128-cbc",
      "aes192-cbc",
      "aes256-cbc",
      "aes128-ctr",
      "aes192-ctr",
      "aes256-ctr"
    ],
    "serverHostKey": [
      "ssh-rsa",
      "ssh-dss",
      "ssh-ed25519",
      "ecdsa-sha2-nistp256",
      "ecdsa-sha2-nistp384",
      "ecdsa-sha2-nistp521",
      "rsa-sha2-256",
      "rsa-sha2-512"
    ],
    "hmac": [
      "hmac-sha2-256",
      "hmac-sha2-512"
    ]
  }
}
```

### ENFILE: file table overflow (macOS)

macOS has a harsh default limit on open files. Raise it:

```sh
echo kern.maxfiles=65536 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
echo kern.maxfilesperproc=65536 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=65536
sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=65536
ulimit -n 65536
```

### Upload Changed Files does nothing

Historically the command was hidden and had no shortcut (see [liximomo/vscode-sftp#854](https://github.com/liximomo/vscode-sftp/issues/854)). It is now visible in the Command Palette and Source Control view and bound to `Ctrl+Alt+U` by default. It requires a Git repository with at least one commit — it uploads files changed or created **since the last commit**.

### Remote Explorer not refreshing after delete

After deleting a remote file, the tree may not update — manually refresh the parent folder (the ↻ button or `sftp.remoteExplorer.refresh`).

### Known issues fixed in this fork

For historical context (these are already fixed on `develop`):

- **`TypeError: isDate is not a function`** from `ssh2/lib/protocol/SFTP.js` on upload/download — Node removed `util.isDate`, which `ssh2@1.13.0` still used. Fixed via `patches/ssh2+1.13.0.patch`, applied automatically by `patch-package` on `npm install`.
- Compile errors on `develop` (missing command-constant imports, `vscode-uri` default-export mismatch, `string`/`URI` type mismatch) — fixed; `npm run compile` succeeds.
- Test-suite breakage under Jest 28+ and `memfs` stream-close bugs — fixed; all suites pass.

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I upload the contents of a folder, but not the folder itself?**
Set [`context`](#context) to that folder (e.g. `"context": "./build"`) — its contents then map directly to `remotePath`. Full example: [Uploading a folder's contents without the folder itself](#uploading-a-folders-contents-without-the-folder-itself).

**Q: How can I upload files as root?**
A community workaround (may not work everywhere — see [liximomo/vscode-sftp#559](https://github.com/liximomo/vscode-sftp/issues/559)) is:

```json
"sshCustomParams": "sudo su -;"
```

**Q: How do I sync both ways automatically, without any user interaction?**
Use a watcher on `**/*` with `autoUpload`/`autoDelete` plus `syncOption.delete` — full config in [Two-way automatic sync with the watcher](#two-way-automatic-sync-with-the-watcher). This also keeps the server updated when Git changes files (branch checkout, revert).

**Q: Why don't I see dotfiles/hidden files in the Remote Explorer?**
Often a server-side listing setting. With **proftpd**, edit `proftpd.conf` (commonly `/etc/proftpd.conf`, `/etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf`, `/usr/local/etc/proftpd.conf`, or `/usr/local/etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf`) and change `ListOptions "-l"` to `ListOptions "-la"`:

```conf
<Global>
ListOptions "-la"
</Global>
```

**Q: Do I have to store my password in `sftp.json`?**
No — leave `password` out and you'll be prompted on connect, with an offer to remember the password in VS Code's secret storage. You can also save it up front with `SFTP: Save Password` (see [Storing passwords securely](#storing-passwords-securely)). Better yet, use key-based auth (see [Best Practices](#6-best-practices)).

**Q: What do the "Connection refused" / "Connection timed out" / "Host not found" / "Authentication failed" messages mean?**
See [SSH connection error messages](#ssh-connection-error-messages).

**Q: Can I edit files directly in the Remote Explorer?**
Files open read-only by default — use `SFTP: Edit in Local`, or set `sftp.downloadWhenOpenInRemoteExplorer` to make opening a file download it. See [Using the Remote Explorer](#using-the-remote-explorer).

**Q: Sync copies files in the wrong direction / re-uploads unchanged files.**
Sync is timestamp-based; correct clock/timezone differences with [`remoteTimeOffsetInHours`](#remotetimeoffsetinhours).

**Q: Transfers randomly fail on my shared host.**
Lower [`concurrency`](#concurrency) (some servers cap simultaneous operations) and/or set [`limitOpenFilesOnRemote`](#limitopenfilesonremote) if the server runs out of file descriptors.

## 9. Development and Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome — the project is under active maintenance again at [jmwerk/SFTPresso](https://github.com/jmwerk/SFTPresso).

Development requires Node 22 or newer (see `.nvmrc`).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jmwerk/SFTPresso.git
cd SFTPresso
npm install        # applies patches (ssh2, memfs) via patch-package
npm run compile    # production build (esbuild)
npm run dev        # watch mode for development
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript type check (tsc --noEmit)
npm run lint       # ESLint
npm test           # jest test suites
npm run package    # build the .vsix
```

Highlights of the codebase:

- `src/extension.ts` / `src/app.ts` — activation and wiring
- `src/commands/` — one module per command
- `src/core/` — config, file system abstractions, transfer scheduling
- `src/modules/remoteExplorer` — the Remote Explorer view
- `schema/` — the JSON schema that validates `.vscode/sftp.json`
- `patches/` — `patch-package` fixes applied on install
